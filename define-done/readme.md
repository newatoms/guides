> Goal: Explain the basics of a good Definition of Done

# How to define done

In order to know when you are done with something it is always useful to define what state the end result needs to be in before you start creating anything. With a definition of done you state what the functionality and quality the end product has to be after you're done with it.

Or in our case, what has to be verifiably done in order for it to be moved to 'Done'.

You can test your work against your Definition of Done while you are working to get an overview of what still needs to be achieved before it can be delivered/published.

## What are good points on the checklist

You have to be able to test your work against your checklist. This means the checklist should be objective. Anyone who is checking the boxes should have the same threshold for defining something as done.

Good points are unambiguous, clear and testable.

Avoid using terms that can be interpreted in different ways. Beware of _enough_, _multiple_, _good_, _valuable_ etcetera, because someone else might disagree.

Avoid points that prescribe a certain specific solution, leave that up to the producer.
