> Goal: Explain the basics of a good Definition of Done (DoD)

# How to Define Done

In order to know when you are done with something, it is always useful to define in what state the end result needs to be before you start creating anything. With a definition of done, you state the functionality and quality the end product should have when finished.

Or in our case, what has to be verifiably done in order for it to be moved to 'Done'.

You can test your work against your Definition of Done while you are working to get an overview of what still needs to be achieved before it can be delivered/published.

We use a Definition of Done (DoD) when we produce an [achievable](../glossary/achievable.md) or a [milestone](../glossary/milestone.md).

## What are good points on the checklist âœ…?

You have to be able to test your work against your checklist. This means the checklist should be objective. Anyone who is checking the boxes should have the same threshold for defining something as done.

***Good points are unambiguous and testable.***

Avoid using terms that can be interpreted in different ways. Beware of _enough_, _multiple_, _good_, _valuable_ , _clear_, etcetera, because someone else might disagree.

Avoid points that prescribe a certain specific solution; leave that up to the producer.

**Don't**: Everyone must go on vacation enough.  
**Do**: Everyone must be on a vacation at least 24 days per year.

**Don't**: Everyone must have eaten enough after lunch.  
**Do**: No one should be hungry after lunch.

**Don't**: The chair should be sturdy.  
**Do**: The chair shouldn't collapse when it has a hundred kilograms set upon it.  

**Don't**: Everyone needs to be healthy.  
**Do**: Everyone needs to have a BMI within 25% of the average.
