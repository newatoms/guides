## Intro

Why do you need content marketing or branded content? Content marketing is a way to create a bond between a reader and a company. By creating content the reader will thoroughly enjoy, the reader will associate the brand with an awesome feeling and automatically think about that company first whenever searching for a product/service in that domain.

Example: A solar cell company creates blogposts about: 
* how a solar cell work  
* a comparison between green energy products
* where is the future of solar cell power heading?
* a foto collage of employees risking their lives on roofs
