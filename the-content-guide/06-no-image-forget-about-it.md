## No image? Forget about it...

Humans are visual creatures. Research done by [Skyword](http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/enterprise-marketing/skyword-study-add-images-to-improve-content-performance/) has shown that chances a text will be read are increased with **94%** if the article shown has an image.
Photo's and illustrations together with the right title make the reader curious and excited.

> 94% is the growth that an article goes through if it has a relevant main image, compared to an article that has no image at all.

Most important is that the images enriches the article in the sense that they serve the written piece. Apart from esthetics images should create a certain amount of context. A good mantra, with the addition of more multimedia in the back of our minds, is not "form follows content" but "content follows form".
