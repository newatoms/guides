## Intro

Why do you need content marketing or branded content? Content marketing is a way to create a bond between a reader and a company. By creating content the reader will thoroughly enjoy, the reader will associate the brand with an awesome feeling and automatically think about that company first whenever searching for a product/service in that domain.

Example: A solar cell company creates blogposts about:
* how a solar cell work  
* a comparison between green energy products
* where is the future of solar cell power heading?
* a foto collage of employees risking their lives on roofs

So how do you attract readers and keep them engaged? There is an increasing demand for *'high quality content'*. But what is high quality content? What ingrediënts make a nice meal that people will remember? Better yet, how do you get people to ask for and share the recipe?

This guide will describe what ingredients work well together and how you can best present the meal. It will allow you to attract your target audience and keep them maximally engaged. The guide will also explain how you can test your business metrics and how to reach your audience. Most of all, how to create content you can be proud of!

## Originality & authenticity

Good content is original. [Content Farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm) are no longer wanted in these times. Search engines, such as Google, are getting better and better at detecting these 'clickbait sites' and these sites are not received well. Original content is sure to be shared more often. Even more so, why would you say something when it's not worth saying?

> You share content because you want to achieve a certain goal. You want it to be read, and you want the reader to learn something from it.

Apart from originality high quality content also makes a certain promise about the credibility of the text. When sources are been used they should provide authority. Good sources are crucial and make sure that a text is taken seriously.

Be a guardian of the originality and authenticity of your content piece. It's easier sad than done while we all scrape information from different kind of sources. When it's authority in people you interview, articles, books or your own judgement, it's all based on other work. The difference where you as an author come in, is how you handle these sources. Combine them to share new insights.

Repetition is not always a bad thing, it can be a powerful tool, but know that it will only work when it's used for original, compelling observations. High quality content is creative and has the potential to excite audiences.

## Structure & readability

Readers are looking for answers and want to find them in the easiest, fastest way. A well structured text gives guidance and leads the reader towards its conclusion in a gentle, organic fashion. A clear text consists of:

* The title
* An intro
* Headers
* **Bold** and *italic*  
* Short paragraphs
* Clear quotes

A strong and remarkable *title* is important to attract your reader. A good title should activate, interest and excite. Often enough with newspaper articles—also the digital ones— the title is the key component in attracting the reader.

If you have lured your reader with a fantastic title, he/she often decides whether to keep on reading or not based on the first few sentences. This brings us to the intro of the text and the importance hereof.

> If the title and image are the bait, the intro is the line that has to be strong enough to pull the reader in.

The *intro* is officiously the first paragraph, and also supports a well chosen title. With this beginning the reader is either triggered and will stay, or not. Readers will scan the intro and decide in just a matter of seconds whether they want to keep on reading. The intro can consist of a promise that you make. Remember that readers are tend to find answers to their 'problems'. They were lured in with the title as a hook and now they really want to know of the content is worth there precious time.

**Bold** en *italic* words make sure that highlighted concepts are cleared up. *Short paragraphs* are there to make the text understandable for the reader. *Clear quotes*, then, invite the reader to keep on reading.

## Visitor behavior

With the ever growing content, the bad and the good, content developers should know how readers behave on the web and how they

According to Jacob Nielsen of the [Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/), a visitor spends an average of less than a minute on a webpage. The visitor usually only has time to read a quarter of the text presented. If the content has a clear message or benefit the chances it will be read are heightened. Quality content aims to give the reader new insights about a specific topic.

## Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) or keyword research, here we go:

Search engine optimisation is a way to (sort of) ensure that people find your website trough search engines like google, bing, google and google.

We believe that the quality, originality and creative components of made content always stands above SEO strategy. However, we do acknowledge SEO as an important strategy when it comes to the visibility of the content. It would be a shame when a written masterpiece floats on the web and isn't picked up by an audience.

SEO can be done in manny ways, and has mostly to do with figuring out what words your target audience searches for and then using those words throughout your article. At New Atoms we don't really do SEO, but it is good to be aware of it as a writer.

### Tackle marketing priorities for SEO

One goal of content marketing is that businesses want to increase traffic. Top named challenges and priorities for marketing professionals –besides creating more _high quality content_ in lesser time— are:

* Measure content effectiveness
* Producing more _engaging_ content
* Metrics that measure Sales lead quality, sales and higher conversion rates.

(sources survey's: [Content marketing institute](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2016_B2B_Report_Final.pdf), Linkedin B2B content marketing report, [Hubspot's The State of Inbound 2015](http://www.stateofinbound.com/))

To meet and tackle these challenges and priorities, content has to be found. _Search Engine Optimisation_ or keyword research strategies help to create a more visible blogpost by readers and enabling businesses to get a lot more traffic.

### Understanding your target audience for SEO

As a content marketeer, writer or other creative, you sometimes wish you could see in the brains of your target audience. With almost everyone connected with the internet, people are using search engines as Google to look for answers or solely entertainment. Nothing new here, but it's important to recognise that current technology enables us to analyse the search behavior of potential audiences. We can therefor use this information for searchable content.

So, implementing the right keywords will get you more traffic from your target audience on your blog. Apart from that, it's just as important and an advantage to really know what your audience wants.   

## No image? Forget about it...

Humans are visual creatures. Research done by [Skyword](http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/enterprise-marketing/skyword-study-add-images-to-improve-content-performance/) has shown that chances a text will be read are increased with **94%** if the article shown has an image.
Photo's and illustrations together with the right title make the reader curious and excited.

> 94% is the growth that an article goes through if it has a relevant main image, compared to an article that has no image at all.

Most important is that the images enriches the article in the sense that they serve the written piece. Apart from esthetics images should create a certain amount of context. So even though images are really important in any article, a image that makes no sense can be way worse than no image at all.

A good mantra, with the addition of more multimedia in the back of our minds, is not "form follows content" but "content follows form".
