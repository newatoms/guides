# How to Formulate a Premise

## What is a premise?
The premise is the basic idea for your story. But it’s not enough to just have an idea. For example, Hero saves girl in World War II, is not enough. This is why your outline needs to begin with a tightly crafted premise sentence. 

It is:
* A [storyline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyline)
* A [theme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(narrative))
* The whole object of everything in a story is to build a case for the premise—it’s your lifeline as a writer
* It’s a red thread through your story—*everything can be traced back to it at every point*

## What are its qualities?
* A premise can usually be stated in very few words or even one word (ex. *humans in conflict with technology* or *nostalgia* or *communication is key*); at most a few sentences.
* Many stories have more than one part to their premise (ex. *power corrupts, but goodness can redeem the corrupted*.
* **A story has an effective premise when you can say what it’s about in a single sentence**.

⬆️ This is a very helpful article that goes into a lot of detail about how to determine your structure and premise. In [7 Steps to Creating a Flexible Outline for Any Story](http://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/7-steps-to-creating-a-flexible-outline-for-any-story) on *Writers Digest* you can read more about the whole outline. The following questions help you to decide on all the elements of your premise:

### Craft your premise

•  Who is the protagonist?

•  What is the situation? What is the hero’s personal condition at the beginning? How will that condition be changed, for better or worse, by the hero himself or by the antagonistic force?

•  What is the protagonist’s objective? At the beginning, what does the hero want? What moral (or immoral) choices will she have to make in her attempt to gain that objective?

•  Who is the opponent? Who or what stands in the way of the hero achieving his objective?

•  What will be the disaster? What misfortune will befall the hero as the result of her attempts to achieve her objective?

•  What’s the conflict? What conflict will result from the hero’s reaction to the disaster? And what is the logical flow of cause and effect that will allow this conflict to continue throughout the story?

Once you’ve answered these questions, combine them into one or two sentences:

Restless farm boy (**situation**) Luke Skywalker (**protagonist**) wants nothing more than to leave home and become a starfighter pilot, so he can live up to his mysterious father (**objective**). But when his aunt and uncle are murdered (**disaster**) after purchasing renegade droids, Luke must free the droids’ beautiful owner and discover a way to stop (**conflict**) the evil Empire (**opponent**) and its apocalyptic Death Star. (*Star Wars: A New Hope directed by George Lucas*)

Here's another example from one of our own articles:

Well-meaning people (**situation**), the users of services (**protagonists**), just want to live and enjoy their lives (**objective**). But when the services that help them enjoy their lives actually harm the planet (**disaster**), they must be more discerning about their activities and choices and demand change (**conflicts, internal and external**) from the companies providing the harmful services (**opponents**).

More concisely:

*With urging from the users, something can be done about earth-harming services.*
* Is this a storyline/theme? ✅
* Can everything in the article be used to build a case for this? ✅
* Is it concise? ✅
