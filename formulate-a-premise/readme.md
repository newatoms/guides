>Goal of this guide: To teach you how to formulate a good premise for your story

# How to Formulate a Premise

## What is a premise?
* A [storyline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyline)
* A [theme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(narrative))
* The whole object of everything in a story is to build a case for the premise—it’s your lifeline as a writer
* It’s a red thread through your story—everything can be traced back to it at every point

## What are its qualities?
* A premise can usually be stated in very few words or even one word (ex. *humans in conflict with technology* or *nostalgia* or *communication is key*); at most a few sentences.
* Many stories have more than one part to their premise (ex. *power corrupts, but goodness can redeem the corrupted*.
* A story has an effective premise when you can say what it’s about in a single sentence.

⬆️ This is a very helpful article that goes into a lot of detail about how to determine your structure and premise.

Here’s their example:

Restless farm boy (**situation**) Luke Skywalker (**protagonist**) wants nothing more than to leave home and become a starfighter pilot, so he can live up to his mysterious father (**objective**). But when his aunt and uncle are murdered (**disaster**) after purchasing renegade droids, Luke must free the droids’ beautiful owner and discover a way to stop (**conflict**) the evil Empire (**opponent**) and its apocalyptic Death Star. (*Star Wars: A New Hope directed by George Lucas*)


Here's another example from one of our own articles:

Well-meaning people (**situation**), the users of services (**protagonists**), just want to live and enjoy their lives (**objective**). But when the services that help them enjoy their lives actually harm the planet (**disaster**), they must be more discerning about their activities and choices and demand change (**conflicts, internal and external**) from the companies providing the harmful services (**opponents**).

More concisely:

*With urging from the users, something can be done about earth-harming services.*
* Is this a storyline/theme? ✅
* Can everything in the article be used to build a case for this? ✅
* Is it concise? ✅
