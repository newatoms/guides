# How to be a Team Member

At New Atoms we work in teams because we think better things are made together. Our teams behave as if they are one.

## Why do we work together?

* It‚Äôs more fun to work together
* It‚Äôs less stressful, your team has got your back
* It isn‚Äôt a problem when someone is not there, you can go on holidayüçπ
* We can combine our talents
* We can make better things this way

## So what is the job of a team member

As a team member your job is not to make the best things or do the most work. It is to make the whole team as productive as possible.

To do this you‚Äôll have to employ all the skills you have‚Äîwherever they come from‚Äîand learn new ones. You‚Äôll have to be super aware of how everyone on your team is doing. And you‚Äôll need to be extra aware of how you are doing.

It is your job to add as much value as possible to what the team does. Even if this means doing something you‚Äôve never done before. Or getting re-energised by going on vacation to the tropics.

## The 6 roles

The roles we defined aren‚Äôt necessarily jobs as such. They are the descriptions of the key roles in any complex creative development process. They are labels that help us figure out what kind of skills we have or miss in a team.

Every team member takes one of these roles to their own ability.  You can change them later on, but as long as you have this role you will have to live it.

### Business

Figuring out how to make money from products and what products should be developed. Business Developers understand the market and can build business.

### Content

Content Developers understand complex stories and make amazing creative works that are made out of the stories. Figuring out what is happening; what kind of concepts are involved; and what the relations between the concepts are.

### Operations

Running the business; making sure everything and everyone is in the right place at the right time; everyone is having fun; taking care of the humans; and making sure everyone knows what they are doing.

### Technical

Technical Developers create systems, this means tooling the necessary software, hardware or infrastructure to make it possible to deliver products, internally and externally.

Especially important is storing data: concepts, relationships, media and stories. Making sure that data input is effortless and fun and making sure the relevant connections are easily made. Making sure great content creation is effortless.

### Experience

The experience is just that: the way our users and clients experience everything we make including its image, its products and its design. Experience Developers keep track of all the values and design that have to work across all output and input, and create beautiful creative works.

### Product

The output of the organisation is through internal and external products. External products might be an online magazine, video channel, app, podcast or other medium. The product developers make sure products are created and take ownership of them.
