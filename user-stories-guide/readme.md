>**Goal of this guide:** to help you to create effective user stories.

## What the eff is a user story?
A user story is a short description of a task to be performed. It can be read as a sentence, consisting of three elements to be filled in by the author of the user story:

>*To* (goal of the task/why it is wanted)

>*As a* (user of the task/who wants it)

>*I can* (possible solution to achieve the goal/what is wanted)

The goal of this guide is how to create an effective user story, so be sure to first read more about what user stories are and how they fit into our workflow in the [board guide](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/board-guide#user-story) and the [turn a pitch into a publishable blog post guide](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/turn-a-pitch-into-a-publishable-blog-post-guide).

## Why the eff are user stories so hard to write?

Here at New Atoms, we like to hyper-rationalise everything by always asking ***why*** ðŸ¤“. User stories are therefore goal-oriented, but identifying that goal can be difficult. Even more difficult can be parsing out where that goal falls on the "hierarchy of why". Confused? So are we. That's why this guide exists!

## The hierarchy of ***why***

When identifying a goal for a user story, the possibilities range from very broad (high on the hierarchy) to very narrow (low on the hierarchy). Goals can also exist across a wide breadth. In other words, goals for user stories are not formulaic, which makes them difficult to pin down sometimes.

Let's say you think a blog post needs a header image. First, figure out why you think this is necessary:

>The client's blog requires that each post be accompanied by an image.

True, but this goal is too narrowâ€”it doesn't actually approach what the value of adding an image is. So, ***why***?

>To illustrate what is being said in the post

Cool, but technically we can do this with our imaginations as we read. So what is a header image actually good for?

>To instantly visualize the content of the article before reading it

Woah, chief! Too far. This is actually impossibleâ€”an [achievable](../glossary/achievable.md) becomes unachievable. Back up a step. What does an image do?

>An image breaks up what is otherwise a wall of text.

Ok, awesome. But ***why*** is that necessary?

>To add visual interest

Definitely super important. But the same could be accomplished without an image. Isn't this also what headings, block quotes or different styles of text do? So what does an image do that text does not?

>Creates a visual context for what will be read

Bingo! ðŸŽ¯ This is the actual function of an image. Thus, the user story:

>*To* be placed within a visual context from which to read the post,

>*As a* blog reader

>*I can* see an interesting header image.

## Chill the eff out
This is not straight forward. It takes a lot of practice, and even then is it still difficult. So don't worry! We'll all be scaling the hierarchy of *why* up and down, back and forth together ðŸ’›.
