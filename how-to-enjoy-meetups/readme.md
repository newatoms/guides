> Goal: Explain what makes Meetups fun, how you can easily socialize and how you can tell your story.

# How to be a Developer

Listen to the person. Try to find something to talk about in which you are genuinely interested (find common ground). They will inadvertently ask what you are doing.

## General tips:
- Perfectly fine to listen to a group talk and only minutes later say something. No value in introducing yourself
- Be engaged by what is happening (the talk, the people around you, the location). These are all things you automatically share with all the other people that are there
- Keep it simple. People will try to help you help them understand it, but thereby often make your job more difficult. Try to explain it in bit sized pieces (instead of beginning top meta level and slowly traveling down)
- Don’t make why you’re there about selling post.supply, you are also/mostly interested in the event and the story of the other party.
- Learn
- Don’t look at your mobile phone. People won’t approach you and you give a insecurity certain vibe.


## So you're in a conversation, now what?
Keep it simple

Explain content marketing with a meet up example, compare:
* Somebody lists for which companies they did projects and how well they did those projects.
* Somebody explains how a mechanism with which they solved a problem* works OR teaches you how to code for free.
The one is selling, the other content marketing. People will have experienced the difference.
Give an example of solving a problem the goal oriented vs the solution oriented way.

Revolve the conversation around the concept of content marketing instead of how their content marketing is at the moment. You will automatically approach that topic since they will be naturally inclined to share their situation.
