>**Goal of this guide:** Helping you to divide the process from idea for an article to a publishable into small separate steps.

# How to turn a pitch into a publishable auricle
In this guide i will try to explain how to divide the process from idea to end result in to small workable steps that are all individually publishable articles.

## New Atoms
At New Atoms everyone works a-synchone. This means that nothing you do can depend on something that came before or after it. This enables us to work in a process where everyone can do what they think they add the most value with to New Atoms at that moment and everything we create is continuously intergratable. This means that everything we do should adds to the bigger whole and is able to stand on its own, how ever small the implementation.

To enable us to work this way we work with a [doables board]() witch we fill with user stories, which are more in-depth version of todo post-its.

## How to create and fulfill a user story
A userstory is meant to force you to clearly state what you try to achieve, how you want to do it and who it is for. You can read a more in depth guide about doables and user stories [here]().
If you write the user story keep the following points in mind

* All user stories are written from the perspective of the end user.
* Collected information to fulfill user story is a byproduct, never the goal on its own.
* All finished user ([pull request]()) story should add value to the whole and be publishable on their own.
* Te person [merging]() your [pull request]() is responsible for combining all fulfilled user stories of the same article in to one publishable article.
* During the demo it will be decided if the results are good enough to go live.

### Finishing a user story
Before you finish a user story and create a [pull request]() you should check the following points.
* Did it fulfill the userstory?
* Is it better than what it was before?
* Did it not break anything?
* Can it stand on its own?

## How to execute a pitch
This is where to tricky part starts. Because everything you do should be able to stand on its own, all steps towards creating a article should also be executable articles. Think of it like this: Instead of formulating questions to ask you interviewee, you formulate a series of questions that are interesting to think and speculate about, and might bring the reader closer to your goal.

### Collecting information, draw conclusions and tie them together in a coherent story.


### Interview
* Finding out who you need to interview
* Knowing what to ask your interviewee
* Clearing with the account holder how we will approach the interviewee
* Collecting contact information on the interviewee
