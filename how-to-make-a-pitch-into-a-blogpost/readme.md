>**Goal of this guide:** Helping you to divide the process from idea for an article to a publishable into small separate steps.

# How to turn a pitch into a publishable auricle
In this guide i will try to explain how to divide the process from idea to end result in to small workable steps that are all individually publishable articles.

## New Atoms
At New Atoms everyone works a-synchone. This means that nothing you do can depend on something that came before or after it. This enables us to work in a process where everyone can do what they think they add the most value with to New Atoms at that moment and everything we create is continuously intergratable. This means that everything we do should adds to the bigger whole and is able to stand on its own, how ever small the implementation.

To enable us to work this way we work with a [doables board]() witch we fill with user stories, which are more in-depth version of todo post-its.

## How to create and fulfill a user story for an article
A userstory is meant to force you to clearly state what you try to achieve, how you want to do it and who it is for. You can read a more in depth guide about doables and user stories [here]().
If you write the user story keep the following points in mind

* All user stories are written from the perspective of the end user.
* Collected information to fulfill user story is a byproduct, never the goal on its own.
* All finished user story ([pull request]()) should add value to the whole and be publishable on their own.
* Te person [merging]() your [pull request]() is responsible for combining all live user stories of the same article in to one publishable article.
* During the demo it will be decided if the results are good enough to go live.

### Finishing a user story
Before you finish a user story and create a [pull request]() you should check the following points.
* Did it fulfill the userstory?
* Is it better than what it was before?
* Did it not break anything?
* Can it stand on its own?

## How to execute a pitch
This is where to tricky part starts. Because everything you do should be able to stand on its own, all steps towards creating an article should also be executable articles. Think of it like this: Instead of formulating questions to ask you interviewee, you formulate a series of questions that are interesting for the reader to think and speculate about, and relevant towards reaching the goal of the pitch.

### Collect information, draw a conclusions and tie it together in a coherent story.
This is generally everything you do while writing an article. Even if it is fiction or an interview, you always collect information, draw conclusions on that information and tie the whole together into a coherent story. Non of these elements can stand on them selves so they can not be made separately. So the challenge is not how to make the best article, but how to do this in the smallest way, that it is better than how it was before. This way you can still break it up into small parts, but you are never obligated continue to work on something to make it publishable. **It also means that in a perfect world you can close your laptop at any moment and have a publishable story.** Never be afraid that something is not as good as it could be, only focus on making it better than that it was before. This way of working enables an article to become a little bit better every time, without the pressure of perfection.


### Here are some points that might help you to keep thins small.

* If you collect information you try to instantly draw conclusions, write them down at the place in the article that makes the most sense at that moment.

* If you work on an article and you change something, rearrange and adjust the article so that it makes sense with your changes.

* If you plan on interviewing some one, figuring out who to interview and what to ask, also consists out of collecting information and drawing conclusions.

> If you interview something keep in mind you do the following thins:
* Clear with the account holder how you will approach the interviewee
* Collecting contact information of the interviewee
