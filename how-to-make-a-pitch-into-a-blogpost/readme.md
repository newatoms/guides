# How to turn a pitch into a publishable article

In this guide I will try to explain how to divide the process from idea to end result into small workable steps that are all individually publishable articles.

## New Atoms

Before we start the tricky stuff, you should first get a glimpse on how we work.
At New Atoms everyone works asynchrone. This means that nothing you do can depend on something that came before or after it. This enables us to work in a process where everyone can do what they think they add the most value with to New Atoms at that moment, and everything we create is continuously integratable. This means that everything we do should add to the bigger whole and is able to stand on its own, no matter how small the implementation.

To enable us to work this way we work with a [doables board](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/board-guide) which we fill with user stories, which are more in-depth version of todo post-its.

## How to create and fulfill a user story for a blog post

A userstory is meant to force you to clearly state what you try to achieve, how you want to do it and who it is for. You can read a more in depth guide about doables and user stories [here](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/board-guide).
If you write a user story, keep the following mind:

* All user stories are written from the perspective of the end user.
* Collected information to fulfill a user story is a byproduct, never the goal on its own.
* All finished user stories (can also be [pull requests](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#the-pull-request)) should add value to the whole and be publishable on their own.
* The person [merging](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#discuss-and-merge) your [pull request](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#the-pull-request) is responsible for combining all live user stories of the same article into one publishable article.
* During the demo (team meeting) it will be decided if the results are good enough to go live.

### Finishing a user story

Before you finish a user story and create a [pull request](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#the-pull-request) you should check the following:

* Did it fulfill the user story?
* Is it better than what we had before (did it add value)?
* Did it not break anything?
* Can it stand on its own?

## How to execute a pitch

This is where the tricky part starts. Because everything you do should be able to stand on its own, all steps towards creating an article should also be executable articles. Think of it like this: Instead of formulating questions to ask your interviewee, you formulate a series of questions that are interesting for the reader to think and speculate about, and relevant towards reaching the goal of the pitch.

### Collect information, draw conclusions and tie it together in a coherent story.

This is generally everything you do while writing an article. Even if it is fiction or an interview, you always collect information, draw conclusions on that information and tie the whole together into a coherent story. None of these elements can stand on themselves so they can not be made separately. So the challenge is not how to make the best article, but how to do this in the smallest way, that it is better than how it was before. This way you can still break it up into smaller parts, but you are never obligated continuing to work on something to make it publishable. **It also means that in a perfect world you can close your laptop at any moment and have a publishable story.** Never be afraid that something is not as good as it could be, only focus on making it better than that it was before. This way of working enables an article to become a little bit better every time, without the pressure of perfection.

### How to make small user stories for blog posts

* If you collect information you try to instantly draw conclusions, write them down at the place in the article that makes the most sense at that moment.

* If you work on an article and you change something, rearrange and adjust the article so that it makes sense with your changes.

* If you plan on interviewing someone, figuring out who to interview and what to ask, also consists out of collecting information and drawing conclusions.

> If you interview something keep in mind you do the following things:
* Clear with the account holder how you will approach the interviewee
* Collecting contact information of the interviewee
