# How to create awesome written content

This guide is intended for external communication but can also be a source for our in-house content developers.
The target audience is communication professionals. See it as a comprehensive guideâ€”a white paper if you willâ€”to show others our know-how. Because the products we sell are blog posts and web articles, we should be able to display our skills in creating content.

## Intro

Why do you need content marketing or branded content? Content marketing is a way to create a bond between a reader and a company. By creating content the reader will thoroughly enjoy, the reader will associate the brand with an awesome feeling and automatically think about that company first whenever searching for a product/service in that domain.

Example: A solar cell company creates blogposts about:
* how a solar cell works  
* a comparison between green energy products
* where is the future of solar cell power heading?
* a photo collage of employees risking their lives on roofs

So how do you attract readers and keep them engaged? There is an increasing demand for *'high quality content'*. But what is high quality content? What ingredients make a nice meal that people will remember? Better yet, how do you get people to ask for and share the recipe?

This guide will describe what ingredients work well together and how you can best present the meal. It will allow you to attract your target audience and keep them maximally engaged. The guide will also explain how you can test your business metrics and how to reach your audience. Most of all, this guide will tell you how to create content you can be proud of!

## Originality & authenticity

Good content is original. [Content Farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm) are no longer wanted in these times. Search engines, such as Google, are getting better and better at detecting these 'clickbait sites' and these sites are not received well. Original content is sure to be shared more often. Moreover, why would you say something that's not worth saying?

> You share content because you want to achieve a certain goal. You want it to be read, and you want the reader to learn something from it.

Apart from originality, high quality content also makes a certain promise about the credibility of the text. When sources have been used they should provide authority. Good sources are crucial and ensure that a text is taken seriously.

Be a guardian of the originality and authenticity of your content piece. This is easier said than done because we all scrape information from different kinds of sources. Whether it's from the authority of the people you interview, articles, books or your own judgement, most of your knowledge is based on other work. The way in which you handle these sources as the author and how you combine them to share new insights is what makes the difference.

### Reduce the chance of broken links

When creating a blog post, you often use external sources to make a point about something. Linking to [movie clips](https://www.youtube.com/), [scientific papers](https://scholar.google.nl/), other blog posts or [quotes from books](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/books) can give the reader a better understanding of a topic or can increase the entertainment value.

Although linking can increase the value of your written piece, it also makes you dependent on these sources. Other websites can go offline, paywalls might be raised and youtube videos might get banned. We all hate links that donâ€™t work. Itâ€™s therefore valuable to know whether your resources are sustainable. Questions you can ask yourself:

* Who is the owner of the content?
* **Most important but difficult:** Do you trust the owner?
* What are its takes on copyrighting?
* If the resource is a Youtube/Vimeo clip: Do you know of similar videos that got banned? How popular is the video?
* If the resource is an article on a news site: Do articles after a designated time go behind a paywall?
* How old is the source?

Do remember that you can never be 100% sure because you are dependent on external factors. You can however reduce the risk immensely.

## Structure & readability

Readers are looking for answers and want to find them in the easiest, fastest way possible. A well-structured text gives guidance and leads the reader towards its conclusion in a gentle, organic fashion. A clear text consists of:

* A title
* An intro
* Headers
* **Bold** and *italic*  
* Short paragraphs
* Clear quotes
* A conclusion

A good title should activate, interest and excite. Often enough, the title is the key component in attracting the reader.

If you have lured your reader with a fantastic title, he/she often decides whether to keep on reading based on the first few sentences. This brings us to the intro of the text and the importance thereof. [Read more on composing great titles here](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/compose-great-headings).

> If the title and image are the bait, then the intro is the line that reels the reader in. And we can all imagine how much it would suck to fish with a line that breaks every time you catch a fish, so that line needs to be strong.

The *intro* is usually the first thing you read, and hopefully supports a well-chosen title. The introduction's effectiveness in activating the reader determines whether he or she will continue reading the article. This often happens within seconds of the reader's first encounter with the introduction. Remember that they were lured in with the title as a hookâ€”a promise you madeâ€”and now they really want to know if the content is worth their precious time. Showing that it is builds trust.

**Bold** and *italic* words ensure that highlighted concepts are cleared up. *Short paragraphs* are there to make the text understandable for the reader. *Clear quotes*, then, invite the reader to keep on reading.

## Visitor behavior

With the ever-growing amounts of content, content developers should know how readers behave on the web and how they can use that knowledge to their own advantage.

According to Jacob Nielsen of the [Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/), a visitor spends an average of less than a minute on a webpage. The visitor usually only has time to read a quarter of the text presented and if the content has a clear message or benefit, the chances it will be read are heightened. Quality content aims to give the reader new insights about a specific topic.

## No image? Forget about it...

Humans are visual creatures. Research done by [Skyword](http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/enterprise-marketing/skyword-study-add-images-to-improve-content-performance/) has shown that chances a text will be read are increased by **94%** if the article has an image.
Photos and illustrations together with the right title make the reader curious and excited.

Most importantly, images enrich an article in the sense that they support the written piece. Apart from aesthetics, images should create a certain context. So even though images are really important in any article, an image that makes no sense can be worse than no image at all.

Header images should work on their own because the images of your post is often the first and only thing people get to see. **Therefore an image has to be good out of its context.** People are visual creatures and probably only stop scrolling (for example in a Facebook, Medium or Twitter feed) when they see an interesting image.

To make it easier on ourselves, we set some relevant guidelines:

* **A header image should work on its own, out of its context.** The header image is often the first and only thing people see. You want to grab their attention with *appeal*, *comprehension* and *retention*. Want to know more about what makes an image interesting? Read [Ten Tips for Making Interesting Images](https://medium.com/@caitlinwinner/ten-tips-for-making-interesting-images-19a59bd2eea2#.squ547nli).  
* **Images should trigger curiosity.**
* **Images should create a context.** Establish an atmosphere into which you would like your readers to enter.
* **Images need to tell part of the story.** Donâ€™t go for the obvious.

A good mantra, with the addition of more multimedia in the back of our minds, is not "form follows content" but "content follows form".

### The use of movie stills

Copyright law is a hassle and can cause headaches ðŸ¤•. Movie stills for example, can provide an article with valuable context. The copyright law of these creative works is complicated. Yet, there are some arguments that can reduce your stress level while using them. The actual movies are definitely copyrighted, but some argue that movie stills (a very small part of the whole creative work) fall under [*fair use*](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/) material.  

A Report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the [Society For Cinema Studies](http://www.cmstudies.org/?page=fair_use) [discussed this issue](http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/MediaManager/File/Film%20Stills.pdf) and argued that: They not only believe that it is *fair use* to publish film stills, they do not believe that gaining permission should be necessary.

Apart from these sources there are some other arguments in favour of using stills in posts. Using a movie still on a blog to describe the movie, link it to daily life, praise or criticise it will create free publicity for the movie. As long as it is not a post where you crumble the movie to a limp cockroach, the owners will not bother you. Lawyers are expensive! ðŸ’¸

#### What you have to keep in mind!

Insert image source with proper mentions to the ownersâ€™ original work.    

## Ending

Our content developers have acquired all of these qualities throughout their own practices. Additionally, each one of our team members contributes to every post created, which ensures that all these diverse qualities are brought together into one big whole, making for the best content possible, which is pretty awesome.
