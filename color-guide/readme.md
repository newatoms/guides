## Let's Talk About Colours

"What's your favorite colour?" might be one of the most frequently asked questions when getting to know someone—at least amongst children. Colours form a big part of our lives, as they, well, add colour to the world! They stimulate all kinds of feelings: joy, sadness, even hunger. At the same time, they are notoriously difficult to handle. No wonder [some famous designers suffer from 'chromatophobia'](http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=37586) and prefer using only black and white.

Yes, working with colours in a design milestone brings many questions to the table. What do they communicate? What do they say about our product or brand? How many of them do we need in our palette? How to combine and use them? Colours are so prone to perception and taste that they can cause tedious discussions.

Luckily, there are many scientific theories out there that help us make decisions based on valid arguments, rather than idiosyncratic associations that are hard to counter ("let's not do red and yellow, they remind me of communist China!"; '"let's not do red and yellow, they remind me of McDonalds!"; "let's do red and yellow, they grab my attention in public space right away!").

This guide is a start for collecting our knowledge of colours.

### Functionality
To kick off, we can look at it from an angle that is always helpful: functionality. Rather than being there to make things look pretty, we can use colours to do things for us: direct attention, make visual distinction, attribute (functional) meaning...

For example, you will notice that the "buy" button in webshops is always set in a highly contrasting colour. This is no coincidence. Big companies do myriad tests to determine the colour that guarantees the best turnover. Or take two sketches of a poster we use to visualize the New Atoms workflow: one has many colours and looks cheerful and attractive. Good, right? Well, maybe not. The colours don't signify anything except perhaps that the work process is fun.

The second one carries only two colours, with a gradation of red. This transition of tints signifies how each step takes you further in the workflow. Here, the colours make the infographic more readable, rather than just attractive.

### Contrast
So how do we use them functionally? When you are combining different colours, things become more tricky. In order to make them functional, you will need to ensure contrast. This is especially relevant when choosing text and background colours in order to maintain optimal readability. There are three kinds of contrast:

* contrast in hue (e.g. red vs. blue)
* contrast in value (e.g. light blue [tint] vs. dark blue[shade])
* contrast in intensity (e.g. bright red vs. dull red)

If you decide to make contrast with only one of the above, make it a big contrast! When we look at hue, that means making [complimentary rather than analogous](http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm) combinations. When we look at value, that means you don't pick two kinds of light pink, but rather a light and a dark pink.

*The infamous colour wheel. Analogous colour combinations are on the same side of the spectrum, complimentary colours on opposite sides. To play around, check out [Adobe Kuler](https://colour.adobe.com/).*

If you find it hard to decide whether your contrast is sufficient, turn to the internet. It is littered with useful tools, for example [this basic colour contrast check](https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=33FF33,bg=333333). It "allows you to specify a foreground and a background colour and determine if they provide enough of a contrast when viewed by someone having colour deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen."

The check uses an elaborate (and complicated—take some time to look into it) system to gauge the contrast, found in [the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20). To ensure compliance for small texts on coloured backgrounds, you’ll need the test to tick “AAA” (highest score) and “AA” (medium score) quality. But if your text is large (larger than 18 pt), just AA should suffice. As you see, determining good contrast is no straightforward game. Context plays a large part.

### Feelings
Using colours as functional elements is something we have control over. But unfortunately, we can't control everything they do. Colours make us feel things, consequently affecting our mood and behavior. And this is the part where things start to become messy: colours themselves don't carry meaning—we as people attribute it. Of course we are all different, and so colour associations are culturally determined. On top of that, they are subject to personal taste.

Research on colour meaning often contradicts. For a while, it was thought buttons should not be red, as it would evoke negative emotion. Green would convert more. But [in a recent article](http://conversionxl.com/which-colour-converts-the-best/) it was found that the colour itself does not matter at all. Again, it is all about context: the button is the most successful when it contrasts enough with the rest of the website.

Good articles that talk about the meaning of colours therefore typically end with the conclusion to not conclude anything. Helpful, right? Well, we will just keep adding to this guide to at least give you a basic grip, and we sincerely hope it did not incite chromatophobia...
