## Let's talk about colors

"What's your favorite color?" might be one of the most asked questions in the world when getting to know someone - at least in your childhood years. Colors form a big part of our lives, as they, well, add color to the world! But they are also notoriously difficult to handle. It's no coincidence that [some famous designers suffer from 'chromatophobia'](http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=37586) and prefer using only black and white.

Yes, working with colors in a design project brings many questions to the table. What do they communicate? What do they say about our product or brand? How many of them do we need in our palette? How to combine them? Colors are so prone to perception and taste, that they can cause tedious discussions. Luckily there are many scientific theories out there that help us make decisions over valid arguments, rather than idiosyncratic associations that are hard to counter ("let's not do red and yellow, they remind me of communist China!"' '"let's not do red and yellow, they remind me of MacDonalds!"; "let's do red and yellow, they grab my attention in public space right away!").
This guide is a start on collecting our knowledge of  colors.


### Functionality
To kick off, we can look at it from an angle that is always helpful: functionality. Rather than being there to make things look pretty, we can use them to do functional things for us. Direct attention, make visual distinction, attribute meaning... For example, you will notice that the 'buy button' in webshops is always set in a highly contrasting color. This is no coincidence - big companies do myriad tests to determine the color that guaranteed the best turnover. Or take two sketches of a poster we use to visualize the New Atoms workflow. One has many colors and looks cheerful and attractive. Good right? Well, maybe not: the colors don't signify anything – except perhaps that the work process is fun.
The second one carries only two colors, with a gradual use of red. This gradual transition of tints signifies how each step takes you further in the workflow. Therefore we decided to go with this one.

### Contrast
When you are combining different colors things become more tricky. In order to make them functional, you will need to ensure contrast. This is especially relevant when choosing text and background colors, to maintain optimal readability. There are three kinds of contrast:

* contrast in hue (e.g. red and blue)
* contrast in tint/shade (e.g. light blue and dark blue)
* contrast in saturation (e.g. bright red versus dull red)

If you decide to make contrast with only one of the above, make it a big contrast! When we look at hue, that means making a complimentary rather than analogous combinations. When we look at contrast, that means that you don't pick two kinds of light pink, but rather a light and hot pink.

*The infamous color wheel. Analogous color combinations are on the same side of the spectrum, complimentary colors on the opposite side. To play around, check out [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/).*

If you find it hard to decide whether your contrast is sufficient, turn to the internet. It is littered with useful tools. For example [this basic colour contrast check](https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=33FF33,bg=333333). It "allows to specify a foreground and a background colour and determine if they provide enough of a contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen."

The check uses an elaborate (and complicated - take some time to read into it) system to gauge the contrast, found in [the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20). To ensure compliance for small texts on colored backgrounds, you’ll need the test to tick “AAA” (highest score) and “AA” (medium score) quality. But if your text is set big (larger than 18 pt), just AA should suffice. As you see, determining good contrast is no straightforward game. Context plays a large part.

### Feelings
Using colors as functional elements is something we have control over. But unfortunately, we can't control everything they do. Colors make us feel things, consequently affecting our mood and behavior. And this is the part where things start to become messy. Colors themselves don't carry meaning - we as people attribute it. Of course we are all different, and so color associations are culturally determined. On top of that they are subject to personal taste.

Research on color meaning often contradicts. For a while, it was thought buttons should not be red, as it would evoke negative emotion. Green would convert more. But [in a recent article](http://conversionxl.com/which-color-converts-the-best/) it was found that the color itself does not matter at all - it only matters whether there is enough contrast with the rest of the website.
Good articles that talk about the meaning of colors therefore usually end with a conclusion to not conclude anything. Helpful, right? Well, we will just keep on adding to this guide to at least give you a basic grip to work with. And we sincerly hope it did not make you get chromatophobia yet...
