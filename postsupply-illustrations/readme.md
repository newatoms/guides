# How to make awesome illustrations for post.supply

For now, the post.supply uses illustrations to visually communicate it's USP's, and to make the website more attractive to look at (or in any case less boring).

Two things to note:

* **The illustration style may change over time**. In this case, this guide should be adjusted accordingly!

* **Everyone is free to add a second style to this guide**, but it should only be applied to illustrations that are clearly used in a different way/for a different purpose. So rather than simple illustrations that serve to illustrate features, you might think of a big illustration that goes in the the heading of the website, tells a story on its own, is used as a small icon to go on a button, et cetera.
Also make sure that this new style still matches some elements of the existing style.

## Guidelines

Keep these guidelines in mind when creating new illustrations:

#### Material design colours
**All colours from the [Material Design colour palette](https://material.google.com/style/color.html#color-color-palette)** may be used. Right now indigo, green and red are employed. When adding a new colour, consider whether this is really necessary, and whether it matches the existing ones.

*All colors are :white_check_mark:*


#### Multiple shades
The material design colour palette offers **different shades for each colour**. We use these to enrich the illustrations.

#### Single and multiple colors
An illustration may contain a **single, or multiple colours**. Single colours may work well when the role of the illustration is more subdued.

#### Flat colors
An illustration has **'flat colors', no gradients** are used.

#### Keep it simple
To make our life easier, **the illustrations are icon-like: simple lines, 2D style**. You may however use 3D illustrations if you wish, provided they still have a 'flat' style.

#### Filled out
The shapes are **filled in, not outlined**.

 #### Square corners
 The illustrations have square corners, rather than rounded ones.

#### Tip: The Noun Project
To ensure that you stay on the low effort, high value track, you can use [The Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com) as a start for your illustrations. Some of them are free, but most are not. If you don't buy them, make sure to give credit to the author on the website.



#### Good luck!
