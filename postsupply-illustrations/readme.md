# How to make awesome illustrations for post.supply

The post.supply uses illustrations to visually communicate it's USP's, and to make the website more attractive to look at (or in any case less boring).
The illustration style may change over time, and this guide will change with it.

A different style may also be added, but it should only be applied to illustrations that are clearly used in a different way. So rather than simple illustrations that serve to illustrate features, think of a big illustration that goes in the the heading of the website, icons, et cetera.
Also make sure that this new style still matches some elements of the existing style.

## Colour use

Set of guidelines for colour use, with images to illustrate:

* **All colours from the [Material Design colour palette](https://material.google.com/style/color.html#color-color-palette) may be used**. Right now indigo, green and red are employed. When adding a new colour, consider whether this is really necessary, and whether it matches the existing ones.

*All colors are :white_check_mark:*

* The material design colour palette offers **different shades for each colour**. We use these to enrich the illustrations.

* An illustration may contain a **single, or multiple colours**. Single colours may work well when the role of the illustration is more subdued.

* An illustration has **'flat colors', no gradients** are used.

## Shapes and lines

* To make our life easier, **the illustrations are icon-like: simple lines, 2D style**. You may however use 3D illustrations if you wish, provided they still have a 'flat' style.

* The shapes are **filled in, not outlined**.

* To ensure that you stay on the low effort, high value track, you can use [The Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com) as a start for your illustrations. Some of them are free, but most are not. If you don't buy them, make sure to give credit to the author on the website.

## Lines

* The illustrations have square corners, rather than rounded ones.
