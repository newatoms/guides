**Goal of this guide:** Understanding the qualities of a good tagline

# How to write a tagline

A tagline, sometimes called a slogan, is like a mini mission statement. It's a textual/audible representation of a brand, like a logo in writing. Think "Just do it."

A good tagline:

* Shows brand awareness
* Creates an emotional response that sticks in people’s minds long after it’s been seen or heard
* Requires a lot of insight into the company and its people
* Is original
* Is concise
* Is relevant
* Has staying power (is not trendy)
* Is in the language of the end-user
