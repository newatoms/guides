> Goal: Explain what it means to be a developer at New Atoms

# How to be a Developer

At New Atoms, we work in teams because we think better things are made together. Our teams behave as if they are one.

## Why do we work together?

* It‚Äôs more fun to work together
* It‚Äôs less stressful; your team has got your back
* We share responsibilities
* It isn‚Äôt a problem when someone is not there; you can go on holidayüçπ
* We combine our talents
* We can make better things this way

## What is the job of a team member?

As a team member, your job is not to make the best things or do the most work. It's to make the whole team as productive as possible.

By productive we do not mean to produce as much as possible in as little time as possible, whatever the cost. By productive we mean teams and their members have the proper environment and stimulation to do the best and most they can for as long as possible. 

To do this, you‚Äôll have to use all the skills you have‚Äîwherever they come from‚Äîand learn new ones. You‚Äôll have to be very aware of how everyone on your team is doing. And you‚Äôll need to be extra aware of how you are doing.

It's your job to add as much value as possible to what the team does, even if this means doing something you‚Äôve never done before. This could also mean getting re-energised by going on vacation to the tropicsüèù.

## The 6 roles

The roles we've defined aren‚Äôt necessarily jobs as such. They are descriptions of the key roles in any complex creative development process. They are labels that help us figure out what kind of skills we have or miss in a team.

Every team member takes one of these roles according to their abilities. They are flexible and you can move among them, but as long as you have this role, you will have to live it:

* [Content Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/content.md)
* [Experience Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/experience.md)
* [Business Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/business.md)
* [Operations Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/operations.md)
* [Technical Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/technical.md)
* [Product Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/product.md)

A team needs all 6 of the roles to be fully functional. *It is the role of each developer to make sure the entire team is capable of contributing to the role-specific field, not to do everyting within its role by her or himself*. For example, as a Business Developer, it's your job to make sure that the **team** (not just the developer) can do business with the outside world in the most effective manner. 

## What does this mean?

Fulfilling one of the six roles is a way of looking at certain situations. A developer is never personally responsible for, nor obliged to fulfill, [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) that "belong" to their developer role. The developer is tasked with thinking about and defending the territory that comes with the role.

For example: if a client wants to add something to a produced article, the conclusions drawn from this request can be different depending on your perspective as a certain developer:
* Was there anything wrong with the content? [Content Developer]
* How, if applicable, can the company structurally integrate this feedback into the production process? [Operations Developer]
* What effect will ignoring the request have on the relationship with the costumer? [Business Developer]
* How can we optimise the experience of giving feedback? [Experience Developer]
