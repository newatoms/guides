> Goal of this guide: learn about what the role of a developer is at New Atoms

## It's all about the perspective

Being a developer is a way of looking at certain situations.
For example: if a client wants to add something to a produced article, the conclusions drawn from this request can be very different depending on your perspective as a certain developer:
* Was there anything wrong with the content? [content]
* How, if applicable, can the company structurally integrate this feedback into the production process? [operations]
* What effect will ignoring the request have on the relationship with the costumer? [business]
* How can the experience of giving feedback be optimized? [experience]

## The role of the developer

A developer is never personally responsible for, nor obliged to fulfill, [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) that belong to their developer role. The main goal is to notice when something can be (structurally) improved in 'their' field and making achievables accordingly.


## Six types of developers

* [Content](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/content.md)
* [Experience](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/experience.md)
* [Business](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/business.md)
* [Operations](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/operations.md)
* [Technical](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/technical.md)
* [Product](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/product.md)

A team needs all 6 of the roles to be fully functional.
