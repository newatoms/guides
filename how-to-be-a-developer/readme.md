> Goal of this guide: learn about what the role of a developer is at New Atoms

## It's all about the perspective

Being a developer is a way of looking at certain situations.
For example: if a clients want to add something to a produced article, the conclusions drawn from this request can be very different depending on the perspective:
* Was there anything wrong with the content?
* How, if applicable, can the company structurally integrate this feedback into the production process
* What effect will ignoring the request on the relationship with the costumer?
* How can the experience of giving feedback be optimized?

## Six types of developers

* [Content](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/content.md)

* [Business](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/business.md)
* [Operations](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/operations.md)
* [Technical](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/technical.md)
* [Product](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/product.md)

## One should be able to switch roles

Nobody is forever fixed in a certain developer role. It's good to have some experience if you take on a new role but if not, be sure to spend some time reading up on it. A team needs all 6 of the roles in it to be fully functional.

## A deverloper is not responsible for their

The team always takes responsibility. You're also not obliged to pick up [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) that belong to your developer role. Just make sure that you notice when something can be structurally improved and make [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) accordingly.
