# How to be a Developer

At New Atoms we work in teams because we think better things are made together. Our teams behave as if they are one.

## Why do we work together?

* It‚Äôs more fun to work together
* It‚Äôs less stressful, your team has got your back
* You can share responsibilities
* It isn‚Äôt a problem when someone is not there, you can go on holidayüçπ
* We can combine our talents
* We can make better things this way

## So what is the job of a team member

As a team member your job is not to make the best things or do the most work. It's to make the whole team as productive as possible.

With productive we do not mean to produce as much in as little time as possible, whatever the cost. With productive we mean that teams and its team members have the proper enviroment and stimulation to do the best and most they can for as long as possible. 

To do this you‚Äôll have to use all the skills you have‚Äîwherever they come from‚Äîand learn new ones. You‚Äôll have to be super aware of how everyone on your team is doing. And you‚Äôll need to be extra aware of how you are doing.

It's your job to add as much value as possible to what the team does. Even if this means doing something you‚Äôve never done before. Or getting re-energised by going on vacation to the tropics.

## The 6 roles

The roles we defined aren‚Äôt necessarily jobs as such. They are the descriptions of the key roles in any complex creative development process. They are labels that help us figure out what kind of skills we have or miss in a team.

Every team member takes one of these roles to their own ability. You can change them later on, but as long as you have this role you will have to live it.

* [Experience](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/experience.md)
* [Business](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/business.md)
* [Operations](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/operations.md)
* [Technical](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/technical.md)
* [Product](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/gh-pages/internal/jobs/product.md)

A team needs all 6 of the roles to be fully functional and it's the role of each developper to make sure the entire team is capable of contributing to that specific field, not to do everyting within its role by itself. For example, as a business developer it's your job to make sure that the **team** (not just the developer) can do business with the outside world in the most effective manner. 

## What does this mean?

Having one of the six roles is a way of looking at certain situations. A developer is never personally responsible for, nor obliged to fulfill, [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) that belong to their developer role. The developer is tasked with thinking about, defending the territory that comes with the role.

For example: if a client wants to add something to a produced article, the conclusions drawn from this request can be different depending on your perspective as a certain developer:
* Was there anything wrong with the content? [content developer]
* How, if applicable, can the company structurally integrate this feedback into the production process? [operations developer]
* What effect will ignoring the request have on the relationship with the costumer? [business developer]
* How can we optimise the experience of giving feedback? [experience developer]
