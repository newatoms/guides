> Goal of this guide: to teach you how to effectively search on Google

## Search terms

Use concrete, relevant terms. You can search in natural language: ```who was the first person that set foot on the moon```, but you'll get better results by using concrete terms: ```moon first astronaut```.
*Although Google has done an insane amount of research into natural search patterns so in this case you'll find roughly the same*

The kind of words you use will influence the types of sites you'll find. Using jargon terms will lead you to specialized websites, while using more often used terms will likely lead you to overview/learning sites.

> Funny, when I was searching for an example, I found out that Google——when using terms like ```belly pain```——only shows results using ```abdominal pain``` since these sites apparently 'win' from sites using the ```belly pain```.

## Operators

In the search field you can quickly use filters to improve the search results.

```" "``` Use quotation marks to search for the exact phrase.

```-``` Exclude this term from the search results.

```*``` Add an asterisk as a placeholder for any unknown or wildcard terms.


 > So if I would've liked to only find sites using the terms 'belly pain', I would search ```"belly pain" -abdominal```.


```site:``` Only search on pages on this site.

```filetype:``` Filter on filetype, for example on pdf.

```link:``` Search for pages that link to this page. You can also leave search field blank to find all pages linking to the page.

```define:``` Gives the definition of a word.

> Never use a space after the :

Advanced search will enable you to filter on:

```Date``` pages that went online on/between/before/after a certain date.

```Language``` a specific language

```Country``` the country the site is hosted

```Reading level``` a certain reading level

```Copyright``` whether you can freely use the contents of the site

## Reverse image search

Reverse image search is very handy for both finding higher resolutions of a certain image as well for finding the author of the image.

Right mouse button on an image and select ```copy image location```. Go to [images.google.com](http://images.google.com) and click on the camera.

You can also drag an image from a folder on your computer to the [images.google](http://images.google.com) page.

> Some browsers also support a ```search for image on Google``` option when you right click on an image

## Pro skillz: I feel lucky

I feel lucky will enable you to automatically go to the first search result Google finds. This reduces the amount of clicks and time while searching.

In your browser go to ```settings``` or ```preferences```, go to ```search``` and than to ```manage``` or ```add``` ```new search engines```.

#### In Chrome

![new search engine in Chrome](https://i.imgur.com/exa6UiH.png)

Add a new search engine——I called mine Google I feel lucky——and paste the following link in the most right input field: ```http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS264&q=%s&btnI=I%27m+Feeling+Lucky```

Click ```make default```

Type ```go``` as your new keyword for searching with 'normal' Google.

Your default search will now be with I feel lucky, typing go [+ a space] will use the normal Google search.

#### In Firefox

Add the extension  [I feel lucky](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=i+feel+lucky&appver=44.0&platform=mac).

Go to ```settings``` -> ```search```. Set Google IFL as your default and add the keyword ```Go``` to the Google search engine.

Your default search will now be with I feel lucky, typing go [+ a space] will use the normal google search.
