# How to make a new project

So you have an amazing idea that would benefit the client, or New Atoms to the moon and back? Great. Let's make a new project.

### Get started
To prevent our workflow from slowing down, there is no need to vote in achievables for making new projects.
Instead, you can make a new project on your own accord.

To do so, make a new folder in the projects folder of the relevant repository. Keep the folder name as short possible, yet descriptive. So rather than 'how-to-make-a-new-project', call it 'new-projects'. To this folder you add a) title.txt for the title of your project and b) readme.md, in which you put the description of you project.

### Fill in the blanks (and give them proper thought)
A new project always has a Goal, [Definition of Done](define-done), Proposed Methods and Motivation. Take some time to consider these carefully. The clearer you describe your project, the better the results will be.

### Get it reviewed
Finished? Awesome! To get it reviewed, make a new achievable. This should be easy â€“ the Goal of the achievable can mirror the goal of your project, and the proposed I Can is simply the creation of your new project.
Link it to your pull request, and put it in the Done straightaway!

### Get your project commissioned
Once merged, the reviewer will add your new project to the Inbox of the concerned product. Only once it gets commissioned by the product owner you can start adding achievables.
