>**Goal of this guide:** to help you to create and work on a user story for a blog post.

# How to turn a pitch into a blog post

In this guide, we explain how to divide the process from idea to end result into small, workable steps that are all individually-publishable blog posts or have added value to an existing blog post.

## New Atoms workflow

Before we start the tricky stuff, you should first get a glimpse into how we work. At New Atoms, everyone works asynchronously. This means that nothing you do can depend on something that came before or after it and your progress is never hindered by waiting for someone else to finish something. This enables us to work in a process wherein everyone can do what they think they are able to add the most value to at that moment, and everything we create is continuously integratable. This means that everything we do should add to the bigger whole and is able to stand on its own, no matter how small the implementation.

To enable us to work in this way, we work with an [Achievables board](../use-the-achievables-board/readme.md) which we fill with [user stories](../glossary/user-story.md), which are a more in-depth version of to-do Post-its.

## How to create and fulfill a user story for a blog post

A [user story](../glossary/user-story.md) is meant to force you to clearly state what you will try to achieve, how you want to do it and who it is for. There is a ready-made template in which you can create a user story within the "Create" column of the Interface. You can read a more in-depth guide about Achievables and user stories [here](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/board-guide).
If you write a user story, keep the following in mind:

* All user stories require you to identify the goal of your action.
* All user stories are written from the perspective of the end user.
* Collecting information towards fulfilling a user story is never the goal on its own.
* All finished user stories (also called [pull requests](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#the-pull-request) at this stage) should add value to the whole and be publishable on their own.
* The person [merging](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#discuss-and-merge) your [pull request](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#the-pull-request) is responsible for combining all live user stories of the same blog post into one publishable blog post.
* During the demo (team meeting at the end of a sprint), it will be decided if the results are good enough to go live.

### Finishing a user story

Before you finish a user story and create a [pull request](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#the-pull-request), you should check the following:

* Did it fulfill the goal of the user story for whom it was intended?
* Is it better than what we had before (did it add value)?
* Did it not create confusion (Within the blog post or in other blog posts)?
* Can it stand on its own?

## How to execute a pitch

This is where the tricky part starts. Because everything you do should be able to stand on its own, all steps towards creating a blog post should contribute in a way that don't leave loose ends and leave the post in a passably publishable state. Think of it like this: instead of formulating questions to ask your interviewee, you formulate a series of questions that are interesting for the reader to think and speculate about, and relevant towards reaching the goal of the pitch. This in and of itself could be a publishable post.

### Collect information, draw conclusions and tie it together in a coherent story.

This is generally everything you normally do while writing a blog post. Even if it is fiction or an interview, you always collect information, draw conclusions on that information and tie the whole together into a coherent story. None of these elements are passably publishable on their own, so they can not be made separately.

The challenge, therefore, is not how to make the best blog post, but how to create something in a way that requires the smallest amount of effort but still adds value. This way, you can still break the process up into smaller parts but you are never obligated to continue working on one post to its culmination. **It also means that in a perfect world, you can close your laptop at any moment and have a publishable story.** Never be afraid that something is not as good as it could be; only focus on making it better than it was before. This way of working enables a blog post to become a little bit better every time without the pressure of perfection. It also makes for a more dimensional, balanced story because multiple team members can contribute to the final product.

### How to make small user stories for blog posts

In this case, small means *limited in scope*. The core of working efficiently on a blog post is this: **creating ideas for how to add the largest amount of value with the smallest amount of effort.**

Think about the smallest thing you could do to start working on a blog post, or to make the existing blog post better. Think about what you want to achieve and how you are going to do this. For example: if you want to know what makes the organisation you are writing about so good at what they do, you could look at the resumes of the founders and draw conclusions from what they have done related to what the organisation does. A user stories in this case could be:

**To understand what makes [organisation name] good at [service] - as a user - I can read about their combined experience and what it enables them to do.**

* this could be done simply by looking at their education on LinkedIn or one previous employer.

When a blog post is not good enough to go live after the user story is fulfilled, the next person can add something else to the blog post to improve it. This goes on until it's decided by the team that the post is good enough to go live. It's all about finding small ways to add value to the whole and **never** about making the best thing possible.

### Tips for how you can keep a blog post in a consistently publishable state with small user stories

* If you collect information, try to instantly draw conclusions and add them into the blog post in the place that makes the most sense at that moment.

* If you work on a blog post and you change something, rearrange and adjust the blog post or add relevant transitions so that it makes sense with your changes.

* If you plan to interview someone, remember that figuring out who to interview and what to ask can not stand on their own as something publishable. Your task also consists of collecting the  information and drawing conclusions (to learn more on how to prepare and conduct an interview, you can look at this [guide](../interview-guide)).
