> **The goal of this guide:** Explain how you can enable CircleCi to deploy to Firebase

# Two types of automatic services communicate with Firebase

[CircleCi](https://circleci.com/) is a [continous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) service that tests your code. It will for example check whether there are statements that are not closed: { without an }.

Bots listen to events and perform an action based on the type of event. For example, a bot can listen to whether something was added to a Firebase Collection and can notice a specific user of that change.
> we currently use a bot to push a message to slack when a client adds a message to a conversation on the interface

## Difference between a bot and circle in communicating with Firebase
Bots use the firebase secret. Go to the firebaseio url of your database (https://interface-ready.firebaseio.com) and go to secrets.

CircleCi needs a token, not a secret!

### Generate a token for CircleCi:
In the folder of the repository you want to deploy (e.g. interface folder) there is an circle.yml file.
In it you will find the token name CircleCi wiÌ¨ll use when deploying.
Remember the token name (e.g. FIREBASE_TOKEN_READY) of the branch you want to deploy to e.g.:
```
--firebase interface-ready --token $FIREBASE_TOKEN_READY
```


In your terminal:
- npm install -g firebase-tools
- firebase login (this will open a browser window to Github)
- firebase prefs:token
- receive a token.


Open your browser and go to the relevant repository in your CircleCi account (e.g. https://circleci.com/gh/newatoms/interface/).
In the right-top corner you'll see project settings.
In Project settings you have environment variables.

Fill in the token name that is in your circly.yml: e.g. FIREBASE_TOKEN_READY
Fill in the token that you received in your terminal
