# How to visualize programming

## Communicating with a computer
When you are programming you're communicating with a computer. The computer speaks multiple languages but is very strict in the grammar, structure and punctuation of them. It doesn't really care about the content of the message though, so that's completely open to you to fill in as you seem fit.

### Structure

If you start a topic, the computer expects that everything that is discussed until the topic is closed is related to it. If you don't end the topic the computer will _forever_ wait for you to finish it and will therefore ignore the other topics you want to discuss.
Topics can be large and very small.

#### Example:

You can start and close topics by wrapping them in ```<topic>``` and ```</topic>```. The ```/``` will signal the computer to end that part of the conversation. Note that ```<>``` is in the language HTML and other languages have other rules for opening and closing topics.

A large topic is for example ```<style>```. The computer expects that everything between ```<style>``` and ```</style>``` is related to the style of the website - that can be the color of the text.

A small topic is the ```<strong>```. _Text_ in ```<strong>text</strong>``` will be displayed in strong (often bold: **text**).

### Grammar and punctuation

Imagine the most nitpicky person about grammar you know. The computer is infinitely worseðŸ‘¹. Seriously, if you mess up one letter or one ```,``` the computer will indicate that it's not speaking the same language as you are.

### Telling a story

Some topics can only be understood, or function better, if they've been linked to other topics. Depending on the language you can point to another topic within a topic.

> Example: In the language ```javascript``` you have functions, blocks of text designed to perform a particular task. These blocks can point to each other which enables the user to flow through them depending on certain constrains. For example, depending on a music genre, the function ```show musicians within that genre``` will change the musicians in a list to only those that belong to that genre.  

### Two way conversation

Luckily, the computer is pretty vocal about your mistakes. She will notify you of your poor language skills by stating that she doesn't understand a word or ```,```. Her communication channel [is the console](../fixing-errors).

## What can you do with programming?

Every interaction you've ever had with machines is guided by a script. A script is a document which has a 'preprogrammed' conversation between a user and a machine. Some parts of the conversation are still to be filled in by the user, for example by adding a name in an input field, but most of it has been written already (without the user having knowledge of it).

There are a lot of languages, each has it's own functionality and rules. A data analysis script for example will be somewhat different from a script that enables you to draw a picture. Almost all scripts will follow the communication rules stated above though.

Once you've mastered a language you'll be able to write all kinds of functionalities that fall within the scope of that language. Imagine the possibilies ðŸ”®.
