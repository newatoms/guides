# How to Create Effective Hyperlinks

In-text links should be a call to action, inviting readers to act. They should promote engagement in the article rather than distract from it.

### 5 Tips for writing successful Call to Action links

1. Click me (please): Don’t use "click here …" It’s boring, unimaginative and unnecessary, and you owe your readers more than that. It can also sound a little desperate. The fastest fix? Omit those two offending words: "Click here to read more about our company’s history" is perfectly fine as "Read more about our company’s history."

2. Make longer links: As in the above example, don’t be afraid to link phrases or short command sentences. It may actually help draw attention to your link on the page. Just be sure to use this technique judiciously, or else your entire page could be a hyperlinked mess.

3. Action!: If you want the reader to take action – visit another page, download a document, etc. – linking is not enough. In cases aside from providing a reference, there should be a *verb* within the highlighted text.

4. Talk to readers, not at them: One of the problems with "click here" type links is that they are commanding in an impersonal way. If web writing is about striking a conversational tone with readers, links should follow suit. There are many go-to phrases:
* Learn more about our return policy.
* Take a look at our complete line of vitamin supplements.
* Find out why our customer service has been voted no. 1.

5. When a link is just a link: Not every link on your site is a call to action. It’s important to know the difference. Sometimes it’s perfectly fine to just hyperlink a word or phrase. You’re letting the reader know that there’s more information there, if they want it.
