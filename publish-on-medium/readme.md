# How to publish to Medium

At New Atoms we write on our [New Atoms Medium Blog channel](https://medium.com/new-atoms-beta). We write about what we learn and what it's like to start a business. Every team member can pitch ideas for blogposts in the [Slack](../slack-guide/) channel: beta.

This guide is a quick tutorial about how to create a blogpost.

Signup on [Medium](https://medium.com/) and ask Boris van Hoytema to add you as an editor.

## Write and publish

Click on your profile picture and select _new story_. You can now write your blogpost, add images and style your text. The [Medium Help center](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us) is a great resource for getting started and finding help if you get stuck.

To publish a story on the New Atoms Channel, do the following:

If you've written your awesome post, choose add to publication and then click **New Atoms channel**. Once you click on _add draft to publication_ others can review your post in draft & stories.

## Edit

If you're asked to review or edit a Medium blogpost always comment â€”never change it yourself. The writer should always choose to implement suggestions. When commenting on text just highlight the text where you want to comment on. Click the comment icon <img src="../images/medium-review-icon.png" width="20"> and send.

## Publish and post

Before publishing you can attach tags to your post. Choose the ones that are most relevant and have the greatest reach. When you're happy with your blogpost you can push the publish button.

Congratulations! Now it's out in the open. Tweet about it on the New Atoms' [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NewAtoms) account and/or post on the New Atoms' [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/newatoms/).
