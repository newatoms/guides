# How to Devise a Value Proposition

***A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you/use your product.***

## What makes a good value proposition:

* Clarity! It’s easy to understand.
* It communicates the concrete results a customer will get from purchasing and using your products and/or services.
* It says how it’s different or better than the competitor’s offer.
* It avoids hype (like ‘never seen before amazing miracle product’), superlatives (‘best’) and business jargon (‘value-added interactions’).
* It can be read and understood in about 5 seconds.

A value proposition usually takes the form of a tagline. Read more about this in the [taglines guide](../write-a-tagline/readme.md).
