> Goal of this guide: Help you develop products and services to stimulate growth.

# Business Development

Every company needs to have a source of income that is equal to its expenses to avoid bankruptcy. The moment your income is higher, you can start growing.

The job of a businesses developer is to develop and implement growth opportunities. This means that it is also your job to ensure there is ample income to create growth. This can be through selling products and services or finding funding and grants.

There are two ways of generating income. Transactions based on current value and transactions based on future value.

- Current value: Something that you offer that has a direct value to others. This usually is a product or service. These are transactions between supplier and the user.

- Future value: Something that could be great someday. This can be anything, from a product to a movement or phenomenon. This is usually in the form of funding or grants.

## Perspective is key when developing products and services

You can not create growth without valuable products or services and you can't create those without talking to your target audience.

The perceived value of your product or service directly determines your income. This can be the price a user  is willing to pay for your product, the future value of your company to an investor, the effect the government thinks your company might have on the environment, etc..

No one will ever value something more than what they think it is worth to them. The perception of others determines the value of your company and thus your income. No exceptions.

You can not develop your business without understanding the perspective of the others. You can't understand others without talking to them.

## Developing new and existing things

All great ideas start with an assumption. This can be as simple as assuming that others are having the same issues, all the way to thinking you know what others need, think and feel.

When developing a product you will have to make assumption about the needs and behaviours of your users. Assumptions are not bad, but they can be wrong.  

The only way to make sure your assumptions are valid? Testing!

### Testing

Testing sounds quite daunting but can be as simple as sending some emails and making a few phone calls. The whole point is that you talk to people and ask them about problems you are trying to solve. The less you guide the people you are talking to the more you will learn from them.

The point of these conversations is not to sell your idea, but to find out if your assumptions are right.

The goal of testing your assumptions is that, if they are false, you have enough information to come up with a new one.

### Testing your assumptions

After formulating an assumption, for example, teenagers hate the taste of broccoli, you need to understand who you can to talk to test it.

In this case, it would be good to talk to teens, their parents and maybe also the store owners that sell broccoli and broccoli activists.

After you have identified who you need to talk to it is time to figure out what you want to ask them, without giving them the answers you want to hear.

Instead of asking a teen if they also hate the taste of broccoli you could ask them what their least favourite green veggies are and why. If they suggest they do not like broccoli you could ask them what they don't like about them instead of suggesting their parents are shitty cooks.  

By interviewing different involved parties you are more likely to understand all angles of the story.

It could be that teens love broccoli but their parents are incapable of preparing them in a way they like. It could also be that shop owners store them next to something that ruins their flavours or texture.

It could, of course, also be that these teens are being ignorant little shits, that reject eating broccoli because it is thought of as "gross" by their peers.

## Identifying the problems

Let's say your interviews suggest that teens do not dislike broccoli because of the taste but because of their soggy texture.

After some research, you have formulated two possible causes for our texture problem. Either the broccoli's are overcooked or they are old when prepared for dinner. Now you have two new assumptions you can test.

After your second round of interviews, you have found the problem. People are over cooking their broccoli's simply because they are unaware of the effect it has on their food.

## Formulating solutions

After identifying the problem you can let your creative juices flow. This is the time to come up with amazing solutions and how to monetize them.

### Pre-set Limitations

Now it is important to look at all the pre-set limitations you have when developing your product. How much time do you have before it needs to be profitable, what are the resources you have within the company you can use, etc...

### Market research

This is also the moment to investigate the market. Are there other products that solve this particular problem, if so why did you not hear about it in your interviews? How have others monetized their solutions and what do you think would be the best way for you and your users?

When you have done some research, it is once again time to formulate and test some assumptions.

### Keep the loop going

Keep testing and iterating until you feel somewhat confident with your solution and its monetization or you can rule out an opportunity for growth.

Don't go overboard, just make sure you understand what you are doing and why.

### testing the solution

In this case, you came up with an app that tells you what the effects of different cooking times will have on your food. The app will be free but will have purchases for extra functionality such as calorie counters.

Now it is time to test your product with all those teens and parents. Don't hesitate to approach the same people you spoke to, they probably enjoy helping you.

The goal here is not to test a perfect finished product but to find out what your target audience thinks of your ideas. This could be by pitching them your idea or presenting them with the simplest version that simulates what your product could be. In this case, it could be a simple A4 with different preparation times and their results for broccoli, egg and steak.

Talk to your audience and try to find out what they think of your solution. If they don't like it try to find out what it is, so you can continue to change or refine your ideas.

### Sales

Testing your solution and sales go hand in hand. Whenever you meet someone that is interested in your product or service you can simply try to sell it to them, even if it is just a concept. Of course you need to be clear when they can expect what they are buying, but you can always assume you can deliver within your projected development time. It is better to drop clients because your product or service changes than having something great without users. If a lead agrees to buy it once it is done, you have some confirmation and a client, if they don't you should always make sure they tell you why. The best feedback comes from those who decided not to pay for what you offer.

### Dealing with negative feedback

Own ideas and solutions always have a soft spot in your heart. When you hear something negative about something close to you, you often respond from your emotion. This will stop you from asking the right questions rendering the feedback useless. This problem solves itself with time and experience.

A nice midway solution is to record your conversations. Listening to the interview after you have cooled down a bit will help you form new questions and assumptions.
If you are lucky, it will also teach you something about yourself.


## Iterate to create value

The more you go through this cycle, the more it will meet the needs of your users. The more you meet the needs of your users the more value it has for them.

This goes for any type of business development. For improving the value of a product or service, developing new things to stimulate growth or setting up profitable partnerships and collaborations.

Business development is about formulating assumption about the needs of others, testing those assumptions to see if there is an opportunity for growth and iterate with the results if there is.
