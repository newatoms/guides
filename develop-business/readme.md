# Business Development

Every company needs to have a source of income that is equal to its expenses to avoid bankruptcy. The moment your income is higher, you can start growing.

The job of a businesses developer is to  develop and implementing growth opportunities. This means that it is also your job to ensure there is ample income to create growth. This can be through selling products and services or finding funding and grants.

There are two ways of generating income. Transactions based on current value and transactions based on future value.

- Current value: Something that you offer that has a direct value to others. This usually is a product or service. These are transactions between supplier and the user.

- Future value: Something that could be great someday. This can be anything, from a product to a movement or phenomenon. This is usually in the form of funding or grants.

## Perspective

Income is directly determined by your perceived value. This can be the price a user  is willing to pay for your product, the future value of your company for an investor, the effect the government thinks your company might have on the environment, etc..

No one will ever value something more than what they think it is worth for them. The perception of others determines the value of your company and thus your income. No exceptions.

You can not develop your business without understanding the perspective of the others. You can't understand others without talking to them.

## Talking to people

All great ideas start with an assumption. This can be as simple as assuming that others are having the same issues, all the way to thinking you know what ohters need, think and feel. Assumptions are not bad, but they can be wrong. The only way to make sure your assumptions are valid? Testing!

### Testing

Testing sounds quite daunting but can be as simple as sending some emails and making a few phone calls. The whole point is that you talk to people and ask them about problems you are trying to solve. The less you guide the people you are talking to the more you will learn from them. The point of these conversations is not to sell your idea, but to find out if your assumptions are right.
