# Business Development

Every company needs to have a source of income that is equal to its expenses to avoid bankruptcy. The moment your income is higher, you can start growing.

The job of a businesses developer is to  develop and implement growth opportunities. This means that it is also your job to ensure there is ample income to create growth. This can be through selling products and services or finding funding and grants.

There are two ways of generating income. Transactions based on current value and transactions based on future value.

- Current value: Something that you offer that has a direct value to others. This usually is a product or service. These are transactions between supplier and the user.

- Future value: Something that could be great someday. This can be anything, from a product to a movement or phenomenon. This is usually in the form of funding or grants.

## Perspective

The perceived value of your product or service directly determines your income. This can be the price a user  is willing to pay for your product, the future value of your company for an investor, the effect the government thinks your company might have on the environment, etc..

No one will ever value something more than what they think it is worth for them. The perception of others determines the value of your company and thus your income. No exceptions.

You can not develop your business without understanding the perspective of the others. You can't understand others without talking to them.

## Talking to people

All great ideas start with an assumption. This can be as simple as assuming that others are having the same issues, all the way to thinking you know what others need, think and feel. Assumptions are not bad, but they can be wrong. The only way to make sure your assumptions are valid? Testing!

### Testing

Testing sounds quite daunting but can be as simple as sending some emails and making a few phone calls. The whole point is that you talk to people and ask them about problems you are trying to solve. The less you guide the people you are talking to the more you will learn from them. The point of these conversations is not to sell your idea, but to find out if your assumptions are right.

The goal of testing your assumptions is that, if they are false, you have enough information to come up with a new one.

#### Testing your assumptions

After formulating an assumption, for example, teenagers hate the taste of broccoli, you need to understand who you need to talk to in to test it.

In this case, it would be good to talk to teens, their parents and maybe also the store owners that sell broccoli and broccoli activists.

After you have identified who you need to talk to it is time figure out what you want to ask them without giving them the answers you want to hear.

Instead of asking a teen if they also hate the taste of broccoli you could ask them what their least favourite green veggies are and why. If they suggest they do not like broccoli you could ask them what they don't like about them instead of suggesting their parents are shitty cooks.  

By interviewing different involved parties you are more likely to understand all angles of the story. It could be that teens love broccoli but their parents are incapable of preparing them in a way they like. Or that store owners store them next to something that ruins their flavour or texture. It could, of course, also be that these teens are being ignorant little shits. That reject eating broccoli because it is thought of as "gross" by their peers.

#### Formulating solutions

Let's say your interviews suggest that teens do not dislike broccoli because of the taste but because of their soggy texture.

After some research, you have formulated two possible causes for our texture problem. Either the broccoli's are overcooked or they are old when prepared for dinner. Now you have two new assumptions you can test.

After your second round of interviews, you have found out that people are over cooking their broccoli's because they are unaware of the effects of different cooking times.

#### Testing your solutions



##### Dealing with negative feedback

## Drawing conclusions from tests

## Developing business based on your test results

## Developing something new.

Whenever your company is developing something new, it is your job to make sure adds enough value

As a business developer you

## Marketing something existing

## Sales

## Lean

## Agile

## Start testing

## Feedback from users vs nay sayers.
