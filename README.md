# Guides

HiaðŸ‘‹! Welcome to the New Atoms Guides. We write these guides on how to do all the things we do. These serve to teach people interested in our ways, but also to reassure.

Here you can find guides on used tools, communication, workflows, rules and most important, how to make awesome things. It's part of every team member's job to edit the guides in order to share what we learn. There is also [a guide on how to add a guide](contributing.md)!

## All of the guides
