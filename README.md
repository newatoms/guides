## How to make a guide
To create a understandable guide make sure you keep the following points in mind.
* Never assume the reader to understands the terminology you use, so always provide a explanation or a link explaining what you mean.
* Always make clear what the reader can expect to learn from a guide at the beginning of the guide to avoid being disappointed halfway trough.
* People should be able to search for a specific topic in your guide, so make sure you clearly separate different chapters and topics in you guide.
