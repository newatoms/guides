# Guides

HiaðŸ‘‹! Welcome to the New Atoms Guides. We write these guides on how to do all the things we do. These serve to teach people interested in our ways but also to reassure.

## How to make a guide

To create an understandable guide make sure you keep the following points in mind.
* Never assume the reader understands the terminology you use, so always provide a explanation or a link explaining what you mean.
* Always make clear what the reader can expect to learn from a guide at the beginning of the guide to avoid being disappointed halfway trough.
* People should be able to search for a specific topic in your guide, so make sure you clearly separate different chapters and topics in you guide.

## How to add a guide

To add a guide complete the following steps
* Create a new folder within guides a name it [guide-name] replace all " " with "-"
* Copy your guide to `guides/[guide-name]/` and change the name to `readme.md`. This enables the visitor to instantly view your guide when they are in the folder of your guide on github.
* If there are local images in your guide you can store them in `guides/images/[your-image.filetype]`
* The path to your images is `../images/[your-image.filetype]`
* Add the guide to this readme.md on the bottom of the "List of all guides" lists in the following way:    

```
  |[name-guide](folder-name-guide)|[goal of the guide]
```
