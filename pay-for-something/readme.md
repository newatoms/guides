> Goal of this guide: explain how do to pay for something on behalf of the company and get your money back.

# How to pay for something

Things have to be bought. Whether it is your cappuccino in the café where you work or the new fancy glittered stickers we desperately need for the company, we need it and our suppliers need their money.

For almost all expenses, this is how we work:

1. You pay for it using your personal cash,
2. You send the receipt in to our bookkeeping,
3. You get the money back in your next pay cheque after the receipt has been approved by Boris.

## How to send in your receipts

For this you need the ‘ReceiptBank’ app on your phone, or if this doesn’t work you need the ‘IBEO’ app. You can download these from the App Store/Play Store.

This app needs to identify you. For this you need a _Token_, this can be obtained from the bookkeeper, so you probably need to ask Boris for it.

Once logged in to the app you can use it’s camera functionality to take a photo of your receipt and send it in.

**Keep all the physical receipts since the tax office might want to see them someday as proof.**

That’s it, done.
