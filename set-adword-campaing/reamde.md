### What to write and where

There are no true golden rules when making an ad for google, but containing some or all of the following points would greatly increase the effectiveness of you ads.:


* Show your promise
  - People who click ads are probably looking for a solution, if your promise matches what they need they will probably click your ad.


* Show What you offer that will result in the promise
  - If there is a logical relationship between your promise and your product people will probably be more inclined to believe you.  


* Highlight what makes you unique
  - What is it that you offer that sets you apart from your competition. This can be a promise, a tool, a vision, etc.


* Include prices, promotions, and exclusives
  - People often use Google search to make a decision about something. Give them what they need to decide. If you have a limited-time discount or stock an exclusive product, say so.


* Empower customers to take action
  - Are you selling something? Tell people what they can buy. Are you offering a service? Tell people how to contact you. Calls to action like purchase, call today, order, browse, sign up, or get a quote make clear what the next steps are.


* Include at least one of your keywords
  - Keywords in your ad text show your ad’s relevance to what people want. For example, if you've included digital cameras as a keyword, your ad headline could be "Buy Digital Cameras." Learn how to build the best keyword list.


* Match your ad to your landing page
  - Have a look at the page that you're linking to from your ad (the landing page), and make sure that the promotions or products in your ad are included there. People might leave your website if they don’t find what they expect.


* Appeal to customers on mobile
  - People seeing your ads on mobile are more likely to want to know where you are, or to call you. Show your location and phone number with location extensions and call extensions. Also, consider creating ads devoted to people on mobile devices, using the mobile version of your website as a landing page, and offering specials suited to a mobile audience. Keep in mind, your text ads can appear differently on mobile.


* Experiment
  - Create three to four ads for each ad group, and use different messages for each to see which does the best. AdWords rotates ads automatically to show the best-performing ads more often. Learn more about ad rotation.


* Check for common ad text mistakes
  - In order to make sure all AdWords ads are high quality, every ad must meet high professional and editorial standards. That means no  extra    spaces, sTrAnGe CAPITALIZATION, or unclear URLs, to name a few.
