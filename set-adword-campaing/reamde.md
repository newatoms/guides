# Adwords campaign for post.supply

Google Adwords is a service provided by Google that allows you to advertise at the top of specific search results in Google. The viewer will be able to see a clear difference between organic search results and your advertisement. The effectiveness of your AdWords campaign will be largely determined by which search terms (keywords) you want your ad to be shown. You pay for every click on an advertisement, the more popular the keyword the higher the cost per click, which can rack up to over €25 per click!

To make sure you do not go bankrupt from the first day you start your Adwords campaign you can set a daily budget. After setting your daily budget you will be presented with an estimate of daily impressions and clicks. You can use this to determine if you selection of keywords is worth using.

## Budget

Google charges you for each click, making it super important that every click is worth the money. To make sure that the costs don't rack up crazy high, you can set daily budgets. When selecting keywords, it is important to look at the yield vs. the cost. A way to do this is by looking at how much keywords are searched for per month, their suggested bid, and the average revenue your website makes per visitor. With this information, you can compare keywords to determine if they are worth the money and from those that are profitable, which is best for you.

> Because we don't know anything about Adwords, and we don't know our average revenue per visitor, we have decided to create a 4-day campaign with a budget of €300. This way we can quite safely create our first campaign and use the results to improve on future campaigns.

> For a four-day campaign our daily budget should be €75, but because the costs can exceed your daily budget by 20%, we will make our daily budget €60 (80% of 75).

## Keyword quality

When you run a campaign for more than a few weeks, Google gathers enough data to analyze the quality of the keywords you are using. This is done by looking at how relevant your keywords are by looking at the relation between the keyword, advertisement, the destination page and the behavior of the visitor. If the quality of your keywords is above average you get a discount on your cost per click which increases with the higher the quality of your keywords.

## Cost per click

When multiple adds have the same keyword(s) the ad that bids the most money per click (cost per click) is displayed. Google automatically suggest a bid to use, but you can make it as high or as low as you like. The value of your bid is greatly influenced by quality of your keywords.

## Cost per click vs revenue per click

When you are determining how much you want to bid per click, you should look at the average revenue your website has per visitor and stay under that mark with your bids.

>If your website has made €100 profit in sales and over the same period you website has had 200 visitors, your average profit per visitor is €0,50. This means that in order to increase your make a profit you can not pay more than €0,49 per click. The lower you go the more money you will make per click and the less likely you are to win a bid.

## Clicks per daily budget

Search popularity is displayed as "average searched per month" which equals impression. Since we will only run our campaign for four days and the cost per click usually is above €2,50 per click, we have no use for more than 24 clicks per day (720 p/m).

The amount of clicks you can get within your daily budget: [Daily budget]/[cost per click]

If you know the amount of impressions per click you can calculate the amount of impressions you need to reach your budged. Sadly, there is no way to get this info apart from testing with your Adwords campaigns.

## Finding the right keywords for your Adwords campaign

Google Adwords resolves around the matching keywords that are connected to your ad to the keywords used in a search on Google.

The success of your Adwords campaign is greatly dependent on the keywords you chose.

So how do you go about deciding your keywords?

### Determining when people search for your product

Google is a search engine, people us it when they are searching for a solution to their problem. The key to optimizing your keyword choices is by understanding when  your users need to see you and what they would search for.

## Making a selection of keywords you want to use

Now that you have a list of search terms it is time to see what they are "worth".

You can do this by simply going to https://adwords.google.com/ and click 'start your campaign' where you can add keywords to a field.

When the keywords are added google presents you with a number for each of these keywords, which represents Search popularity which is equal to the amount of impressions your ad will get.

> 

You can add three types of keywords: broad matches (the order does not matter), phrase matches (the order matters, but can be surrounded by other words) and exact matches (only the same search terms match up).

In making choices which keywords to use, you will have to find a balance between Search popularity and how well it fits your product.
