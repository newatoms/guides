A [Polymer](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/blob/ready/glossary/polymer.md) element is a custom [HTML element](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp). It can be used like other HTML Elements in your websites, but it can do much more magic as it permits in-built Javascript. Google published [a library of pre-made elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/), but you can also [create your own](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/creating-elements).

An element should fulfill one function and should be reusable in multiple contexts.
