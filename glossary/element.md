*Elements* in HTML are the basic building blocks you use to give your content structure. They have an open tag that can have attributes, contents and a close tag. They are written with a start tag, with an end tag and with the content in between. Elements are the building blocks of any HTML document.

With the [aid of Polymer](start-using-polymer/readme.md) you can define your own elements, with their own logic and design.
