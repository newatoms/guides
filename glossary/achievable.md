An achievable consists of a goal to be reached successfully through a single task, with the least effort. There are two types of achievables:

* Addition: add something new. These are written as a [user story](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/board-guide#user-story).
* Repair: repair something which is broken; not working the way it should. These are written by simply stating what is broken.
