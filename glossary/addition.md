An *addition* is a type of [achievable](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/blob/ready/glossary/achievable.md), where you add something new (as opposed to a [repair](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/blob/ready/glossary/repair.md))

*Additions* are formulated as [user stories](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/blob/ready/glossary/user-story.md).
