Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a [Pull Request](../glossary/pull-request.md) (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done automatically via a Pull Request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line. For more information, see [Merging a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/).
