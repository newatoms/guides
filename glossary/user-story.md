A *user story* is a short description of a task to be performed.
It can be read as a sentence, consisting of three elements to be filled in by the author of the user story:

To _benefit_, As a _user_, I can _method_
1. Benefit: this is what the user will be able to do after this need is fulfilled.
2. User: who needs this, for who are we doing this.		
3. Method: What could be done to fulfill this need.

The benefit is first since it is the most important thing, it could be fulfilled expending less effort using a different method, which should then be done.
