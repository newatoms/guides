A <b>user story</b> is a short description of a task to be performed.
It can be read as a sentence, consisting of three elements to be filled in by the author of the user story:

1. <u>To</u> (goal of the task / why it is wanted)

* <u>As a</u> (user of the task / who wants it)

* <u>I can</u> (possible solution to achieve the goal / what is wanted)
