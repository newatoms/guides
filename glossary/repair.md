A repair is a type of [achievable](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/blob/ready/glossary/achievable.md) where you repair something which is broken, i.e. not working the way it should.

*Repairs* are documented by simply stating what is broken and, if applicable, instructions on how to get the broken result. 

Examples: 
The log out button gives an error in the Interface. If you open the web inspector while in the Interface and click on the button log out in the navigation menu, an error is displayed.

In the text 'These awesome things' in the post 'example post' it is not clear what **these** refers to.
