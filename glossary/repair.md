A repair is an [achievable](achievable.md) where you repair something which is broken, i.e. not working the way it should. If it is broken to such an extend that the product is no longer functioning, it is a [breaking bug](breaking-bug.md). 

*Repairs* are documented by simply stating what is broken and, if applicable, which steps to take in order to find the bug. 

Examples:
A click on the "log out" button gives an error in the Interface. If you open the web inspector while in the Interface and click on the button "log out" in the navigation menu, an error is displayed.

In the text 'These awesome things' in the post 'example post' it is not clear what **these** refers to.
