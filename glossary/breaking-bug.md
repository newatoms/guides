A [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) is a term used in software development to describe an error, flaw, failure or fault that causes the concerning product to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. 

At New Atoms, a breaking bug is type of [repair](../repair.md) that fundamentally prevents the product concerned from functioning, and therefore should be attended to immediately. It can therefore be produced without voting it in.
