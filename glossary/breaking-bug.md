A [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) is a term used in software development to describe an error, flaw, failure or fault that causes the concerning product to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. 

At New Atoms, a *breaking bug* is type of bug that fundamentally prevents the product concerned from functioning, and therefore should be attended to immediately. It can therefore be produced as a [repair](repair.md) without voting it in.
