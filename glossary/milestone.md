Milestones are significant stages in the development of a [product](product.md). Like [achievables](achievable.md), they have a [definition of done](../define-done/readme.md) and go through distinct [phases](phase.md) before completion. 

Once commissioned, milestones are sorted on priority by the [product developer](product-developer.md).
