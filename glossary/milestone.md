Milestones are significant points in the development of a [product](product.md). Like [achievables](achievable.md), they have a [definition of done](../define-done/readme.md) and go through distinct [phases](phase.md) before completion.

This word replaces “Project”. The milestone is a particular point that we want to pass, not a specific thing we want to build. The word “Milestone” helps us think about the bigger picture, what we’re trying to achieve in the grander scheme of things. It forces us to be thoughtful that the work doesn’t end when we pass a milestone.

Milestones start out as a pitch. Once commissioned, milestones are sorted on priority by the [product developer](product-developer.md).
