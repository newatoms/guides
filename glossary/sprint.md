A sprint, in conventional terms, is "an act or short spell of running at full speed over a short distance". For New Atoms, a sprint, similarly, indicates a short duration of steady working that is fixed in advance.

At the beginning of a sprint, the team votes on which [achievables](achievable.md) will be put into "Next" on the [achievables board](../board-guide/readme.md). During a sprint, each team member works consistently on voted-in achievables from the *Next* column of the achievables board and reviews those fulfilled by other team members. At the end of a sprint, there is a presentation during which we explain what we've done and why.
