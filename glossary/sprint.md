A sprint, in conventional terms, is "an act or short spell of running at full speed over a short distance". For New Atoms, a sprint, similarly, indicates a short duration of steady working that is fixed in advance (at this point, around two days).

Before a sprint, the team votes on which [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) will be put into "Next" on the achievables board. During a sprint, each team member works consistently on achievables (also called "cards") from the *Next* column of the Interface and reviews the achievables fulfilled by other team members.
