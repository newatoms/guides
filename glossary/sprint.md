A sprint, in conventional terms, is "an act or short spell of running at full speed over a short distance". For New Atoms, a sprint, similarly, indicates a short duration of steady working that is fixed in advance (at this point, around two days).

Before a sprint, the team votes on which Achievables will be put into "Next" in the Achievables board. During a sprint, each team member works consistently on Achievables (also called "cards") from the *Next* column of the Interface and reviews the Achievables fulfilled by other team members.
