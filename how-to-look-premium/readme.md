So, you have set up an awesome service and you are ready to take it to the market. You have done your research and you know you have more to offer than much of the competition. Therefore you decide to put your pricing in a higher segment. Yes, you are a premium service, spending much time and effort on your product, and your clients will have to pay for that. But how to convince them you are worth it? Here's a few points to help you get started, inspired by [this article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217176).

1) Help your costumers understand why the price is higher: highlight your unique features. If you know how competitors are undercutting your prices, and you feel the competitors' lower cost equates to poorer quality or service, explain this difference.
2) Go the extra mile. Show our clients that you appreciate them choosing you over other cheaper options. Not just by being friendly, but by for example delivering a bottle of wine to show them you appreciate their trust.
3) Stick to your price, even when times are tough. Otherwise you will not generate enough cash flow to maintain your high quality service.
4) Project financial stability in your service – otherwise you’re too much of a risk.

## Get the looks

You can highlight your unique features until the cows come home – if you don't communicate them in a convincing way, all effort goes to waste. This starts with clear and good writing (see this [guide on how to write well](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/writing-guide)), but it by no means ends there. It's also about looks. On your website or any other means of communication, make sure to present your features in an attractive way. A few ideas:
* [Add suiting pictures or illustrations](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/effective-image-guide) to clarify and brighten up your points.
* Keep your texts short and simple. This means that you get to the point as fast as you can, rather than writing entire bookworks.

* Try to focus on the benefits of your features, rather than the features itself. Most people don't care that you have made a state-of-the-art custom interface designed with this or that framework. All they want to know is what that means for them.
* Give your separate features some literal space to breathe. This allows for the reader to let them sink in as he or she scrolls through your website.
* Last but not least: the book has to match the cover. Make sure to have a nice design that suits your premium service! Think about it as if buying fancy clothes, or furniture. You want the design of the store to reflect the value of the product you're buying. If Sacks would look like Primark, you'd feel conned when checking out the pricetags.
