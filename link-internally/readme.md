> **The Goal of this guide**: showing you how to link between guides and glossary items on the guides [repository](../glossary/repository.md).

# How to link internally

For our guides repository we create relative links when we want to link to other guides or glossary items.

For example if you're working on a guide and you are talking about a *achievable* for example you link like this:

```[Achievables](../glossary/achievable.md)```

And not absolute linking like this:

```[Achievables](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/blob/ready/glossary/achievable.md)```
