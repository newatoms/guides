# Pitch post.press at the websummit

First off, it is really important that we should never try to sell our product.

We offer a solution to a problem. As long as we are able to explain the problem and how we solve it, those that have the problem will see the value in what we do.

The product should sell itself, as long as people know what the product is and have a need for it. If not, we need to redefine the product, not try to sell harder.

## The basics of what we do and why we do it


### Problem

Regular agencies are dead.

Getting the right content produced for your company can be a huge hassle. The endless meetings and slow turnover-times with agencies and freelancers alike are a pain. Making sure that all content is in the right tone of voice and forms one seamless body is even worse.

### Solution

We are convinced that understanding always trumps talent. Not only are different perspectives and skills better suited in telling the right story in the right way, it also enables you to adapt strategies and mediums in a whim.

When making your pieces of content with a team you can have a quicker turn-overrate, use the mediums that suits your goal best and adapt to the needs of your audience on a whim.
you can be medium agnostic allowing you to be more flexible, scalable and speak the visual and cultural language of your audience.

## Our goal

We strive to reduce the hassle while optimising the quality an efficiency of content production for organisations.

## How to tell this story

When telling the story for the first time, the most important thing is to tell only what is necessary, when necessary, in such a way that there is a logical transition.

This is something you will only learn with practice, so don't worry if you don't get it right the first 50 times.

Just keep trying to explain what we do and why we do it. At some point, you will get the hang of it.
