With [Slack](https://slack.com/) we say goodbye to email. Well, certainly for all internal communication. All communication in Slack, just like in [Github](guithub-guide.md) and on the [board](board-guide.md) should be in English. Get to know Slack for real on [Using Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606).

Slack is an awesome tool for chatting, file sharing and archive searching. Important take-ways of conversations should always be in Slack so conversations will never be lost.

You will get an invite from one of New Atoms' admins. What are you waiting for? Signup, download the [Slack desktop application](https://slack.com/downloads) and download the app for your smartphone.

## Channels

We organise our team conversations in open channels. We make channels per project or product. Apart from these project channels we have an inspiration channel, if you want to share interesting links or articles or if you invented an amazing quote. A general channel, here messages go when every New Atoms member should be notified. And last but not least, the Random channel, for all the fun things happening and please post your favorite Gifs here ðŸŽ‰.

All messages most be on topic and send in the designated channels. You can favorite channels by starring them. You can mention certain people in a channel with a *@name*.

## Direct Messages

To reach a team member directly, send them a Direct Message. It's completely private and secure.

## Talking to Howdy the Robot

For our daily standup we use the Howdy bot. Because we like to talk to robots and because it makes a summary of all three answered questions. At 1000Z Howdy starts talking to every team member, don't be nervous, just answer his questions. When everyone completed the talk with Howdy it will post a summary in the standup channel.

Happy Slacking!
