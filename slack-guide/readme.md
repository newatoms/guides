## Why we use Slack

Within Newatoms we try to keep all our comunicatnion documented, so that we can later acces all those awesome insights, and a synchronous, so that no one ever has to wait for eachother. Chat is perfect for these two things, and slack is a great chat tool.

## About Slack

Slack is an amazing chat tool, that lets you chat privately with one or multiple people, create and manage channels, send and archive files of all different types, lets you integrate other programs, enables you to automate processes and a bunch more.

Your can download the [Slack desktop application ](https://slack.com/downloads) for your computer and you can get the app for your smartphone in the app store.

## How we use Slack

With [Slack](https://slack.com/) we say goodbye to email. Well, certainly for all internal communication.

When you become part of Newatoms you will get an invite from one of the admins, this wil enable you te become part of the Newatoms Slack team and join all our channels.

Due to our international nature all communication within Newatoms is in English, so also everything you say in Slack. We do this to make sure that everyone can use the amazing archive search functions of slack regardless of their language and nothing we share or learn ever gets lost.

Next to private chat and chatrooms you know from traditional chat programs, Slack introduces open and private "Channels"

* Open Channels are for conversations that are open to all team members. Messages posted to channels are archived and searchable to the entire team. Everyone in the Newatoms team can join all the open channels. Open channels have the "#" symbol in front of their name.

* A private channel and its contents are visible and searchable only to the channel members. In order to become part of a private channel you need to be added by a admin of that specific channel. Private channels have a closed lock icon in front of their name.

We organise our team conversations in channels. We make channels per project or product. Apart from these project channels we have a bunch of extra channels that are quite self explanatory. We have an inspiration channel, if you want to share interesting links or articles or if you invented an amazing quote. A general channel, here messages go when every New Atoms member should be notified. We also have a random channel, for all the fun things happening and please post your favorite Gifs here ðŸŽ‰. We got a improvement channel where you should post your ideas on how we can improve stuff, from processes to behavior.

All messages must be on topic and send in the designated channels. You can favorite channels by starring them.

You can mention and notify certain people in a channel with a *@name*.   

### Direct Messages

To reach a team member directly, send them a Direct Message this can be done by selecting them from the direct message column on the left of the window. If the person you are trying to send a message is not in the list you can add them by clicking the private message heading. Direct messages are completely private and secure.

### Markdown

Slack enables the use of [markdown](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/github-guide#markdown-), which is a writing that is also used in html. It enables you to add accentuations to text, hide url's, use emojis.

You can also generata a random gif about a subject by typing "/giphy [subject]". Pretty cool.

### Talking to Howdy the Robot

For our daily standup we use the Howdy bot. Because we like to talk to robots and because it makes a summary of all three answered questions.

With the standup we try to get a overview on what everyone is working on, what they have worked on so far, how they feel and if anything is blocking them.

This can help us recognize and solve problems, keep everyone happy and its a great moment for yourself to reflect on what and how you are doing.

At 1000Z Howdy starts talking to every team member, don't be nervous, just answer his questions. When everyone completed the talk with Howdy it will post a summary in the standup channel.

Happy Slacking!
