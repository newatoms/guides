## Why we use Slack
Within Newatoms we try to keep all our comunicatnion documented (so that we can later acces all those awesome insights) and a synchronous (so that no one ever has to wait for eachother). Chat is perfect for these two things, and slack is a great chat tool.

## About Slack
Slack is an amazing chat tool, that lets you chat privately with one or multiple people, create and manage channels, send and archive files of all different types, lets you integrate other programs, enables you to automate processes and a bunch more.

Your can download the [Slack desktop application ](https://slack.com/downloads) for your computer and you can get the app for your smartphone in the app store.    


## How we use Slack
With [Slack](https://slack.com/) we say goodbye to email. Well, certainly for all internal communication. All communication in Slack, just like in [Github](guithub-guide.md) and on the [board](board-guide.md) should be in English. To get more indepth information about the functionality of slack you can check [this](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606)  over view by Slack.

When you become part of Newatoms you will get an invite from one of New Atoms' admins. This wil enable you te become part of the Newatoms team and join all our channels.

### Channels

We organise our team conversations in open channels. We make channels per project or product. Apart from these project channels we have an inspiration channel, if you want to share interesting links or articles or if you invented an amazing quote. A general channel, here messages go when every New Atoms member should be notified. And last but not least, the Random channel, for all the fun things happening and please post your favorite Gifs here ðŸŽ‰.

All messages most be on topic and send in the designated channels. You can favorite channels by starring them. You can mention certain people in a channel with a *@name*.   

### Direct Messages

To reach a team member directly, send them a Direct Message. It's completely private and secure.

### Talking to Howdy the Robot

For our daily standup we use the Howdy bot. Because we like to talk to robots and because it makes a summary of all three answered questions. At 1000Z Howdy starts talking to every team member, don't be nervous, just answer his questions. When everyone completed the talk with Howdy it will post a summary in the standup channel.

Happy Slacking!
