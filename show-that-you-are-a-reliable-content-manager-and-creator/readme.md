# What makes a content manager and creator convey reliable?

We have done some research on what people look for to determine whether a content manager and creator is reliable. These where some key points that we agreed with.

* A highly organized, detail-oriented working style: with telling a coherent story with all that you publish, you need to be able to keep track of all that has been and will be created.

* Writing or editing skills: everything written that is visible to the prospect should clearly convey that you are capable of using copy as a tool to reach your goals

* Experience with a variety of content management tools: in order to manage all the content that goes on in all different channels it is key to be able to automize the distribution of the content. Either you should be capable of working with the system that is in place or bring in your own.  

* Content marketing: very logical, but also very hard to show and convey. It should be very clear that you understand what content marketing is and how you can use it to reach specific goals.

* Search Engine Optimization (SEO): content is discovered by prospects and existing customers, often, through search engines. Even though we are firm believers of sharing through value, it is important to understand what it is and how you think it should or should not be used.

* Social Media Marketing: because most of what you make is for, or reached through social media it is paramount that you understand how social media works and how you can use it to achieve your goals.

* Analytics: it is important that you are capable of tracking the effectiveness of the content you put out, so that you can optimize it. This can only be done by measuring, because none of us can look in other people brains. Can they?
