# How To Compose Headings that Attract and Keep Readers

While your carefully crafted content might be amazingly groundbreaking, nobody will read it if your headlines and subheads are not up to par. Alas, it is an unfair world. So what to do? Educate yourself! Coming up with good headlines will never be like shooting fish in a barrel, but knowing what makes them work will help you get started.  

*Warning: more fishy puns ahead.*

## Headlines: the hook to *get* readers
Headlines are paramount because they determine whether people will get to your article in the first place. They have to stand out amongst the massive streams of content potential readers have to navigate. Here, some pointers:

### How clickbait headlines work (you won't believe it!)

Consider the typical clickbait headlines introduced by media such as Buzzfeed and Upworthy. You might hate them, we understand that. We are not suggesting you mimic them. But it is worth analysing what makes them work. The headings never fail to set certain expectations (to be entertained, surprised, amazed, et cetera). Upon clicking, the content is more often than not disappointing, but this doesn't detract from the effectiveness of the headline.

So how do these headings manage to get clicked? In a three-month quantitative research endeavour, [Venngage](https://venngage.com/blog/7-reasons-why-clicking-this-title-will-prove-why-you-clicked-this-title/), concluded that the headlines of popular articles included the following factors:

* **Elements of shock (found in 79% of the analysed articles)**: *You Won't Believe This, This Will Blow Your mind, Inspiring!, Gorgeous! and other superlatives*... this plays a role in setting high expectations (that are rarely met).
* **Depicting recent media events (63%) or unknown events (67%)**: *Instagrammer Matches Makeup to Socks, Bernie Sanders Will Win the Democratic Nomination and Presidency in a Landslide*... It is even said by academics that we are hardwired for news. It is in our physical interest to stay informed and keep up with the news.
* **Topics: pop culture and food (63%)**: *I Went To Beyoncé’s Formation World Tour And It Changed My Life, This Mac And Cheeseburger Is The Only Friend You Need*... Food and pop music—apparently the most popular topics amongst clickbait readers.
* **Hint of personal stories (29%)**: *I Went To A Justin Bieber Show and..., Why My Experience In Kenya Changed Me For Good...* People like reading candid personal stories. After all, we all have human interest (and a little voyeurism).
* **Lists (17%)**: *[x] Ideas To, [x] Unknown Facts About...* [Wired tells us that these list work](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/defense-listicle-list-article/) because they help us order the sea of information we are in. They also save time, as they are exceptionally suitable for quick skimming. The reader can decide to explore further from there. Plus, the promise of sheer quantity is attractive.
* **Animal references (8%)**: *People Are Scaring Their Cats With Cucumbers, This Dog Is Completely Obsessed With Bananas And It's Adorable*... This simply proves even more that people love animals, especially cats. There are over 2 million cat videos on Youtube alone.
* **Other notable things**: Many articles start out with "How To...", address the reader, and ask questions: *Why You Should...*

### What we should learn from clickbait
Now we know the common factors of clickbait. But what actually makes them work? Which of the above headlines do it right?

A big aspect of their effectiveness is that they spark **curiosity**. They give some things away, but not all. But sparking curiosity by just leaving out information won't get you far enough. In a survey, Facebook found out that 80% of the respondents preferred headlines in their newsfeed that helped them decide if they wanted to read the full article.

In short, ***the headline should be a balance between creating curiosity and clarifying why people should read it and what they will get***.

Plus, it is said that the most successful headlines focus on **benefits**. So rather than saying: *This Old Trick Will Change Your Company For Good*. You could say: *How To Achieve Your Company Goals With This Proven Method*.

Lastly, as you might well know: clickbait is often manipulative and deceitful. It promises things it does not deliver. It goes without saying, but we'll say it anyway: stay away from this. Also keep in mind who your audience is. They are probably not your typical Huffington Post reader and won't appreciate outrageous headlines as much.

### Other practical tips for writing headlines that work

Usability researcher Hoa Loranger from The Nielson Norman Group wrote [a great blog post on headlines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/headings-pickup-lines/). Some tips:

* **The header should be able to work on its own**. Because headlines are currently placed out of its context, shared on social media or only visible in feeds between others. More than often the headline is the only thing they read.

* **Moving keywords to the front of headlines increases the likelihood that they get noticed**. Yes, we know readers don’t have time. Now we see in usability research that the majority of **people only scan the first few words of the headline**. 

* **Try out more than 25 headlines** with this [headline analyser](http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer). It is fun and you’ll see that the quality of your headlines will improve.

* **Make your hed (headline) more effective with a dek (subtitle)**. This way, your title can be short and sweet, sparking curiosity. Your subtitle can be more specific about what the reader can expect.

## Subheads, the barbs to *keep* readers

Subheads might actually be as important as headlines. Think about it—when you start reading an article, you first skim through it to ensure you won't be wasting your time. You might read the first two sentences and look at the main images. They tell you a lot. But subheads tell you even more about what to expect. Based on this, you decide whether the article is worthy of your attention.

A few tips and tricks to create knock-out subheads:

Do:
* Make sure they all spark at least some curiosity.
* To make them more compelling, craft your headings to have an element of surprise, personality or emotion.
* First write your post as you normally do, then at the end scroll through your article and see how the subheads line up. Do they tell the story together?
* Look at your paragraphs as separate blogposts, and figure out whether the subhead reflects the content well.

Don't:
* Use headings as plain labels. It's better than nothing, but has the risk of being boring.
* Give away all the paragraph has to offer. Because then, why would the reader continue?
* Get too creative or cryptic. If people don't understand what you're getting at at all, they will be gone.

This guide will be extended over time! Until then, happy headings ⛵️.
