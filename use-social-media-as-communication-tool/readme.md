# Social media guide

Social media is an extremely amplified version of word of mouth communication.
It has the potential reach of traditional broadcasting and the context of word of mouth.

## The fundamentals of social media

Here you will find some points that will help you to successfully use social media for communication purposes.

* What someone tells you influences the way you perceive them and vice versa
* The sender always lends connotation (emotional association) to the message and the message always lends connotation to the sender.
* The sender is always visible.
* Everything you say and share is documented, visible and broadcasted for a short duration to all involved accounts and their followers. This duration is extended every time someone interacts with it.
* Whenever you like something it is documented on the liked item and broadcasted to all affected accounts. This duration can not be extended and the action is not visible on your profile.
* Everyone using social media has the possibility to get infinite reach
* For Twitter the broadcast time is roughly 15 minutes, for facebook this is about 90 minutes and for linkedIn it is over 48 hours.
* Everything you broadcast reaches your followers and the followers of people who interact with your broadcast, during the time it is broadcasted.
* Only people directly affected by your actions get a notification, the rest is reached through their news feed.
* People generally don't click, interactions with messages of big brands are 00,7% on average and roughly 1-2% for the average commercial profile.

## How you could use social media

Traditional use of social media is to reach and convey a direct message to your target audience

Social media is the best way to reach a lot of people, but It is meaningless if: there is not an immediate benefit for the receiver if the receiver does not know who you are. The biggest misunderstand of communication is that people expect a direct return of investment.

* Expectation: I see something i like, i interact with it.
* Reality: I see something i like but don't specifically and immediately need, i remember it and keep on doing what i'm doing.

The memory your message leaves is the cornerstone of content marketing. If you try to convey too many meaningless messages people stop listening.

The best use of social media is not only to reach and convey a direct message to your target audience, but also to build and maintain a relationship.

Building a relationship and broadening your reach is done in the same way: be relevant for your target audience and leave a positive memory.

Communicate from your beliefs and don't be afraid to share the secrets of the trade. The competition will always be different, your clients will never be able to do it as well as you do and the knowledge you share only manifest’s your confidence and capabilities

## What do people share?

To broaden your reach you want people the share what you say.

* Everything you share on social media reflects directly to your personal profile.
* People share when what they share fortifies the way they want people to see them
ie: funny, smart, attractive, knowledgeable, etc
* When it has a positive effect on them and they want to share that with their friends
* When they want to call attention to something
current events, etc

## Practicality

In general, people only briefly look at what they see on social media. Therefore the first sentences or image they see, should capture the reader in a way that is in line with what the message you're conveying.

People hardly click on links (1%-10%), even if it has a instant relevance.  Therefore you should limit use of tinyurl and bitly to urls of which the names are not relevant or obvious.

Try to keep your content on a minimal amount of different sources and and channel it through social media. If using video, try to keep all your material on one provider. Try to avoid confusion where readers can find the content again.

Be consistent in language, frequence, and use of external services such as eventbrite.
