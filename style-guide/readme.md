# How to refine your writing style

## Recognise what style is and what it's building blocks are

You already have a writing style. It's what sets your writing apart and makes it unique. We're sure it's ridiculously awesome. But we're always looking to improve and to do everything more effectively, therefore we want to think about why awesome writing is awesome so that we can apply those reasons to everything we write.

The internet is already flooded with style guides, so no need to reinvent the wheel here. Check out:
* [this guide](http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/few/684), which focuses on word choice, sentence fluency and voice,
* [or this one](http://literarydevices.net/style/), which is about different types of style,
* [or perhaps this one](http://www.writersdigest.com/writing-articles/by-writing-goal/improve-my-writing/brush-up-on-your-style-in-10-minutes-or-less), which is a practical list of suggestions to improve style.

You get the idea.

## Ask yourself questions as you write

As with everything, asking questions is important during the process writing and determining style.

* For whom are you writing (**audience**)?
* What is the **context**?
* Why do they need to know what you are going to tell them (**purpose**)?

Style is not a matter of right and wrong but of what is appropriate for a particular setting and audience. To state the obvious (hey, sometimes it needs to be done), if you're writing about quicksand, your style is going to be vastly different if you are writing for children as opposed to your fellow scientific quicksand researchers.

## Read stuff and pay attention

When you read something you like, think about what's great about it and why. How did the author connect to you? We will demonstrate.

[This](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) is an extremely long but very well-written blog post about artificial intelligence. You only need to read the first couple of paragraphs to get a good idea of the writer's style (otherwise you'll still be reading when we're all having our first coffee tomorrow morning).

Here are some following thoughts:

* I remain engaged despite it's crazy length. Why?
>It reads more like a story than an article on technology because it follows a **narrative progression** and has elements of **storytelling** like fictitious characters and settings.

* I've laughed out loud several times. Why?
>The author incorporates **down-to-earth humor** at just the right spot on the spectrum between goofy and smart. Humor also keeps me engaged despite its length, punctuating the content with **comic relief**. This also makes a potentially heavy subject lighter/easier to read about because it's less threatening.

* Though it's about complex ideas, I have no difficulty comprehending the content (it's accessible). Why? 
>The author uses **vocabulary** that is sophisticated but not convoluted and uncomplicated but not dumb. Using this vocabulary, he creates **straightforward examples** to describe otherwise complex ideas. He **does not make assumptions** about what the reader knows but also does not assume the reader is stupid--he finds an effective equilibrium. He keeps the tone **humble** by often using himself as an example of ignorance or non-off-putting, self-deprecating humor.

* It doesn't make me feel like an idiot for the things I don't know. Why? 
>The writer uses **"we"** and **"our"** rather than "you" and "your", including himself in the group that wishes to understand.

## Keep working on it
Your style is yours alone. Keep it awesome. Be aware of what makes it what it is, ask yourself lots of questions as you're writing and reading, and continue to refine.
