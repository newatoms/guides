# How to Use Narrative Conflict

## What is [narrative conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_(narrative)) and how do I use it effectively?
* An inherent incompatibility between the objectives of two or more characters or forces
* It creates tension and interest in a story by adding doubt as to the outcome
* It is often the central unit of the plot
* Can be internal or external
* The easier it is for the protagonist to triumph, the less value there is in the drama
* It can be resolved at the end of a story, but does not have to be (if notâ€”>"open ending")
* There can be multiple conflicts and types of conflict in one story
* The most consistently recognized types of literary conflict are:
  * human against human
  * human against society
  * human against nature
  * human against self
