First off, it is really important that we should never try to sell our product.

We offer a solution to a problem. As long as we are able to explain the problem and how we solve it, those that have the problem will see the value in what we do.

The product should sell itself, as long as people know what the product is and have a need for it. If not, we need to redefine the product, not try to sell harder.

## The basics of what we do and why we do it


### Problem

Advertising is dead.

We are all sick and tire of the large amounts of aggressive and pushy content that have no real value and drowns out the content that actually is valuable, waisting a lot of recourses in the process. 

In order to build a meaning full relationship with your audience you need content that they have a use for, instead of somting that infulences the way they see you.

### Sollution

We are convinced that you can build a meaning full relationship with your audience by using content as a tool to achieve the goals of your company.

The best way to do this is by enabling your audience to be part of the solution to the problem your company is trying to solve, enabling your audience to solve the problem without your service. 

This way, you show the importance of what you do, you validate your expertise, you are valuable to your audience and you get closer to achieving the goals of your company.

Instead of using a roblem to make money, you actively stimulate others to solve the problem while offering your service to those how do not have the time to do it themselves. 

### Our product

We do the same thing ourselves, we teach you how to use content to achieve the goals of your compeny trough our website. If you do not have the time or the skill to create the needed content, our team can make it for you via our application.

**Our website** is the place where we publicly store all the lessons we have learned about reaching goals through good content. Our website is always the first place we look when researching for new articles. By making our research public, we hope to enable others to do this as well.

**Our application** allows the user to manage a multidisciplinary journalistic team that collaborates closely to create articles that achieve the goals of the user. Using the online interface, the user can decide the goal of the publications, commission proposed articles and approve them when they're done.

**Apart from creating the right content, the main focus of the application is to enable users to have and maintain a steady flow of content that is made by a multidisiplinary team with the least amount of effort.**

**Our work Method** enables us to have team members work on the same articles simultaneously from their own strengths while covering where others are less proficient. This enables us to create diverse articles that are not subject to the knowledge and experience of one writer, allowing us to be able to scale and adapt where necessary. We call this Agile Journalism.

## Our goal

Our main goal is to stimulate the use of content as tool to reach the goals of companies. We want to reduce the amount of pushy and empty content and increase the amount of communication that is actually valuable for the receiver.

## How to tell this story

When telling the story for the first time, the most important thing is to tell only what is necessary, when necessary, in such a way that there is a logical transition.

 This is something you will only learn with practice, so don't worry if you don't get it right the first 50 times.

 Just keep trying to explain what we do and why we do it. At some point, you will get the hang of it.
