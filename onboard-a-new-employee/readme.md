## Contracts

Contracts can be found in the folder [contracts](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/tree/ready/internal/contracts), the employee's details should be added to the folder [employees](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/tree/ready/internal/employees)

## Don't overburden them

We use quite some tools and some of the (Achum *Github* Achum) require a quite abstract understanding and others (Achum *Intercom* Achum) don't always work the way you think they'll work. Make sure the new employee knows that they can ask 1 person questions whenever they encounter something they don't understand.
