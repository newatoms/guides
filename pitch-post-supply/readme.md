First off, it is really important that we should never try to sell our product.

We offer a solution to a problem. As long as we are able to explain the problem and how we solve it, those that have the problem will see the value in what we do.

The product should sell itself, as long as people know what the product is and have a need for it. If not, we need to redefine the product, not try to sell harder.

## The basics of what we do and why we do it

### Problem

Advertising is dead.

We are all sick and tired of the large amounts of aggressive and pushy content that have no real value and drowns out the content that actually is valuable, wasting a lot of resources in the process.

In order to build a meaningful relationship with your audience you need content that they have a use for, instead of something that influences the way they see you.

### Solution

We are convinced that you can build a meaningful relationship with your audience by using content as a tool to achieve the goals of your company.

The best way to do this is by enabling your audience to be part of the solution to the problem your company is trying to solve; enabling your audience to solve the problem without your service.

This way, you:
* show the importance of what you do
* validate your expertise
* are valuable to your audience
* get closer to achieving the goals of your company.

Instead of using a problem to make money, you actively stimulate others to solve the problem while offering your service to those who do not have the time or skill to do it themselves.

## Our goal

Our main goal is to stimulate the use of content as a tool to reach the goals of companies. We want to reduce the amount of pushy and empty content and increase the amount of communication that is actually valuable for the receiver.

## How to tell this story

When telling the story for the first time, the most important thing is to tell only what is necessary, when necessary, in such a way that there is a logical transition.

This is something you will only learn with practice, so don't worry if you don't get it right the first 50 times.

Just keep trying to explain what we do and why we do it. At some point, you will get the hang of it.
