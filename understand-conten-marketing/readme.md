# What the flying fuck is content marketing?

In The Rise of Storytelling as the New Marketing,
Joe Pulizzi describes Content marketing as “the idea that storytelling is key to attract and retain customers.”

The first known example of content marketing is a magazine, first published in 1895, called *the Furrow*, published by John deere (a company that sells tools for farmers). This magazine did not have the goal of selling farmers equipment, but solely to a source of knowledge for farmers making John Deere an expert on fram equipment. And sure enough when those farmers needed new gear they would go to the expert they knew and trusted, John Deere.

The next few quotes from the journal of marketing management in the article “Understanding digital content marketing”, Jenifer Rowley describes some key notions about content marketing.

“...a recurrent theme in DCM (digital content marketing) is customer value, and this leads into the second major contribution of the article, an exploration of the notion of customer value in digital content marketplaces.”

“The difficulty in developing a notion of 'value' in the context of digital content”

“The customer's experience of digital content is influenced by all stakeholders in the value chain as well as requiring the customer to participate in learning and co-creation of the experience.”

“The potential of the 'value-in-use' notion of customer value as a basis for ensuring that consumers are fully engaged as stakeholders in the content economy. ”

## What you need to know in order to make awesome content marketing

So the first part of the guide we used a bunch of quotes to help you understand what content marketing is and what its struggles are. In the rest of the guide we will try to explain a few concepts which might help you create awesome content marketing. Everything beyond this point is our own interpretation and by no means a unwavering truth.

### The relation between connotation and context

What someone tells you influences the way you perceive them and vice versa, this means that the sender always lends connotation (emotional association) to the message and the message always lends connotation to the sender. Lending and receiving connotation is always a two way street, but the scope of the context the conveyed message is bound to, determines the amount of connotation the message lends or receives. If you try to convey something that is bound to a certain context it loses all relevance the moment it is perceived outside of its intended context. The broader the context, the more connotation it lends. When what you sends lends more connotation than that it needs, it will add to the connotation of your name, which in turn adds to the connotation of everything you send. This is called branding.

### Branding

Branding is loading a name with connotation. The problem with branding is that it has always been the necessity of showing your name in something that is supposed to call on emotions. The use of your name shows you did not make this out of the kindness of your heart, but did it to influence the way people think about you, which in turn greatly influences the way they think about what they see. If you don't show your name, people don't know who the sender is which defeats the purpose.  We have been trying to work around this for quite a while, making phased campaigns which reveal the sender in a later phase, making the sender the “sponsor” of a message, using product placement and sponsoring of events and organisations. A lot of companies have been really successful this way, but it is hard to do and usually very expensive.

### How everything is communication

The way you dress and walk, the way you drink your coffee, the way you answer your phone, everything adds to the way people perceive you. If you do it right, they way you are can be a strong communication tool. The moment you are who you say you are, and everything you do shows it, you communicate without putting in any extra effort. This is by far the most effective way of branding.
The downside is that it is only visible to those already interacting with you.

### Word of mouth

Who you associate with has always been a big part of how people view you. Having pretty, friendly or successful friends makes you look good. This way you use the connotation some one has with a person and link it to yourself through the relationship you have with them. This works the same with word of mouth. When someone speaks positively of you it is not only the message they convey that has value, but also the fact that they take the effort to speak about you and the connotation the receiver has with the speaker.
In advertisement, when you have people speaking for you or even endorsing you, it has the same problem as branding. The personal incentive, which made it valuable, is removed the moment it is suspected there is money involved.

### Social media as main sidekick of content marketing

If used right, social media can work around a lot of the problems traditional communication has, get a bigger maximum reach and is free.

It always shows the name of the sender, solving the branding issue
people can share your messages from their own incentive, creating the connotation and reach of word of mouth. It extends your presence to the outside world, so everyone can see the way you behave.

### Conclusions

Don't act different than who you are, if you want people to perceive you differently, change!
Let your main goal be to reinforce your beliefs, don't let the means be your goal. Make your context as broad as possible. Make your content relevant and relatable. Traditionally the goal of communication is to make people do something with the information that is communicated. The goal of content marketing is to for people take something away from your messages and interact with them.
