# What the flying fuck is content marketing?



## Branding
Branding is loading a name with connotation. The problem with branding is that it has always been the necessity of showing your name in something that is supposed to call on emotions. The use of your name shows you did not make this out of the kindness of your heart, but did it to influence the way people think about you, which in turn greatly influences the way they think about what they see. If you don't show your name, people don't know who the sender is which defeats the purpose.  We have been trying to work around this for quite a while, making phased campaigns which reveal the sender in a later phase, making the sender the “sponsor” of a message, using product placement and sponsoring of events and organisations. A lot of companies have been really successful this way, but it is hard to do and usually very expensive.

## Everything is communication
The way you dress and walk, the way you drink your coffee, the way you answer your phone, everything adds to the way people perceive you. If you do it right, they way you are can be a strong communication tool. The moment you are who you say you are, and everything you do shows it, you communicate without putting in any extra effort. This is by far the most effective way of branding.
The downside is that it is only visible to those already interacting with you.

## Word of mouth
Who you associate with has always been a big part of how people view you. Having pretty, friendly or successful friends makes you look good. This way you use the connotation some one has with a person and link it to yourself through the relationship you have with them. This works the same with word of mouth. When someone speaks positively of you it is not only the message they convey that has value, but also the fact that they take the effort to speak about you and the connotation the receiver has with the speaker.
In advertisement, when you have people speaking for you or even endorsing you, it has the same problem as branding. The personal incentive, which made it valuable, is removed the moment it is suspected there is money involved.

The solution? Social media!
If used right, social media can work around a lot of the problems traditional communication has, get a bigger maximum reach and is free.

It always shows the name of the sender, solving the branding issue
people can share your messages from their own incentive, creating the connotation and reach of word of mouth
It extends your presence to the outside world, so everyone can see the way you behave.

## Giving incentive
So what you want, is that people speak positively about you with personal incentive.
This can be done by saying something about you, but just sharing or even liking your messages is enough. The best way to do this, is simply, by giving them a reason to.
To do this it is important to know why people interact with messages on social media.

Your social media profile is a definition of who you are. It is your public resume, it is your dating profile and your portfolio. So with everything you share and say you should ask yourself, is this portfolio material? would i endorse this and how does it look with the rest of my profile?

Because you only reach the people during the time your broadcast, it can often be good to broadcast the same message multiple times, and still giving the receiver a reason to share it all those times.

This is the main reason why non profit organizations and education are so successful on social media with consumer goods, retail and ecommerce far behind in second place.
Their messages are directly relatable to the people sharing them and lend a strong connotation to the sender and the sharer.

Conclusions 1 + 1 = 11 punten
Don't act different than who you are, if you want people to perceive you differently, change!
Let your main goal be to reinforce your beliefs, don't let the means be your goal.
Make your context as broad as possible.
Make your content relevant and relatable.


Traditionally the goal of communication is to make people do something with the information that is communicated.

The goal of social media is to make people interact with your messages and take something away from them.

A solution to this problem presented itself with the rise of social media and increase in personal reach. Pay a popular person to endorse your product from there own profile and hide the fact that you payed them. Effective but very risky since it is borderline immorale.
