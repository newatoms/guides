> Goal of this guide: Helping you use Adwords

# Adwords

Google Adwords is a service provided by Google that allows you to advertise at the top of specific search results in Google. The viewer will be able to see a clear difference between organic search results and your advertisement. The effectiveness of your AdWords campaign will be largely determined by which search terms (keywords) you want your ad to be shown. You pay for every click on an advertisement, the more popular the keyword the higher the cost per click, which can rack up to over â‚¬25 per click!

To make sure you do not go bankrupt from the first day you start your Adwords campaign you can set a daily budget. After setting your daily budget you will be presented with an estimate of daily impressions and clicks. You can use this to determine if you selection of keywords is worth using.

## Budget

Google charges you for each click, making it super important that every click is worth the money. To make sure that the costs don't rack up crazy high, you can set daily budgets. When selecting keywords, it is important to look at the yield vs. the cost. A way to do this is by looking at how much keywords are searched for per month, their suggested bid, and the average revenue your website makes per visitor. With this information, you can compare keywords to determine if they are worth the money and from those that are profitable, which is best for you.

## Keyword quality

When you run a campaign for more than a few weeks, Google gathers enough data to analyze the quality of the keywords you are using. This is done by looking at how relevant your keywords are by looking at the relation between the keyword, advertisement, the destination page and the behavior of the visitor. If the quality of your keywords is above average you get a discount on your cost per click which increases with the higher the quality of your keywords.

## Cost per click

When multiple adds have the same keyword(s) the ad that bids the most money per click (cost per click) is displayed. Google automatically suggests a bid to use, but you can make it as high or as low as you like. The value of your bid is greatly influenced by quality of your keywords.

## Cost per click vs revenue per click

When you are determining how much you want to bid per click, you should look at the average revenue your website has per visitor and stay under that mark with your bids.

>If your website has made â‚¬100 profit in sales and over the same period you website has had 200 visitors, your average profit per visitor is â‚¬0,50. This means that in order to increase your make a profit you can not pay more than â‚¬0,49 per click. The lower you go the more money you will make per click and the less likely you are to win a bid.

## Clicks per daily budget

Search popularity is displayed as "average searched per month" which equals amount of impressions.
The amount of clicks you can get within your daily budget: [Daily budget]/[cost per click]

If you know the amount of impressions per click you can calculate the amount of impressions you need to reach your budged. Sadly, there is no way to get this info apart from testing with your Adwords campaigns.

## Finding the right keywords for your Adwords campaign

Google Adwords resolves around the matching keywords that are connected to your ad to the keywords used in a search on Google.

The success of your Adwords campaign is greatly dependent on the keywords you chose.

So how do you go about deciding your keywords?

### Determining when people search for your product

Google is a search engine, people use it when they are searching for a solution to their problem. The key to optimizing your keyword choices is by understanding when your users need to see you and what they would search for.

First you should determine what the added value of your product is, who your key users are, and when they would need your product.

### Making a selection of keywords you want to use

Now that you have a list of search terms it is time to see what they are "worth".

You can do this by simply going to https://adwords.google.com/ and click 'start your campaign' where you can add keywords to a field.

When the keywords are added google presents you with a number for each of these keywords, which represents Search popularity which is equal to the amount of impressions your ad will get.

You can add three types of keywords: broad matches (the order does not matter), phrase matches (the order matters, but can be surrounded by other words) and exact matches (only the same search terms match up).

In making choices which keywords to use, you will have to find a balance between Search popularity and how well it fits your product.


### Keyword criteria

There is more than just search popularity to what makes a keyword good. There is also 'Competition'. Competition is the number of advertisers that were shown for each keyword relative to all keywords across Google. So when there is low competition, it means there are relatively little other advertisers using this keyword. High competition means that many advertisers used this keyword, with a high probability of having a high cost-per-click. Search terms that have a high search popularity probably also have a high competition, but not all do! It pays off to look for these with the Keyword planner in Google Adwords (found under ```Tools``` in the top menu).

To start, add a short description of the product/service and the website. Then, you can filter on 'low competition'. Google will then get to work and get you endless lists of suggested search terms. It is useful to sort at either search popularity (high to low) or cost-per-click (low to high), and look at the relationship between the two. High search-popularity x low cost-per-click = jackpot! ðŸ’ª

### What to write and where

There are no true golden rules when making an ad for Google, but containing some or all of the following points would greatly increase the effectiveness of you ads:


* Show your promise
  - People who click ads are probably looking for a solution. If your promise matches what they need they will probably click on your ad.


* Show What you offer that will result in the promise
  - If there is a logical relationship between your promise and your product people will probably be more inclined to believe you.  


* Highlight what makes you unique
  - What is it that you offer that sets you apart from your competition? This can be a promise, a tool, a vision, etc.


* Include prices, promotions, and exclusives
  - People often use Google search to make a decision about something. Give them what they need to decide. If you have a limited-time discount or stock an exclusive product, say so.


* Empower customers to take action
  - Are you selling something? Tell people what they can buy. Are you offering a service? Tell people how to contact you. Calls to action like purchase, call today, order, browse, sign up, or get a quote make clear what the next steps are.


* Include at least one of your keywords
  - Keywords in your ad text show your adâ€™s relevance to what people want. For example, if you've included digital cameras as a keyword, your ad headline could be "Buy Digital Cameras." Learn how to build the best keyword list.


* Match your ad to your landing page
  - Have a look at the page that you're linking to from your ad (the landing page), and make sure that the promotions or products in your ad are included there. People might leave your website if they donâ€™t find what they expect.


* Appeal to customers on mobile
  - People seeing your ads on mobile are more likely to want to know where you are, or to call you. Show your location and phone number with location extensions and call extensions. Also, consider creating ads devoted to people on mobile devices, using the mobile version of your website as a landing page, and offering specials suited to a mobile audience. Keep in mind, your text ads can appear differently on mobile.


* Experiment
  - Create three to four ads for each ad group, and use different messages for each to see which does the best. AdWords rotates ads automatically to show the best-performing ads more often. Learn more about ad rotation.


* Check for common ad text mistakes
  - In order to make sure all AdWords ads are high quality, every ad must meet high professional and editorial standards. That means no  extra    spaces, sTrAnGe CAPITALIZATION, or unclear URLs, to name a few.

#### Headline 1

This is the first thing people see of your ad, this would be a good place to show:

* The promised result of using your service
* Your most important keyword

#### Headline 2

This is the second thing people see of your ad, this would be a good place to show:

* What you offer that will result in the promise
* Your second most important keyword

* Highlight what makes you unique
* Include prices, promotions, and exclusives
