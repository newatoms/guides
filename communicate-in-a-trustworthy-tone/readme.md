# How to communicate in a way people will trust

The most important part of conveying trust, is being trustworthy. Do not use this guide to convince others that you are trustworthy if you are not. That will almost always backfire. 

If your are trustworthy and sincere, this guide will help your convey that to the outside world.
Trust is important precisely because the entire purchase experience depends upon trust in order to be successful.

Every conversion is an indication that trust has been won. Every new customer represents a person whose trust has been earned. Every return customer represents a person whose trust continues to be held. Without trust, there is no such thing as conversions, customers or revenue.

### Words and language should:

* Show that your interests are the same.
* Demonstrate concern for others.
* Deliver on your promises.
* Be consistent and honest.
* Communicate frequently, clearly and openly.

This is particularly interesting, when thinking about what words to use:

"The very sound of words (phonology) has an effect on their usage, understanding and trustworthiness. As Cornell researchers recently discussed in an issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, “The sounds of words contain information about their syntactic role. … Phonological typicality affects both the speed with which we access words in isolation as well as when we process them in the context of other words in a sentence.” This reality has a profound impact upon the trustworthiness of given words.

For a long time, researchers and linguists have concurred that 'the sounds of some words fit the meanings particularly well' (Michael Wertheimer, The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 71, No. 2 [June 1958], pp. 412-415). The better the fit, the greater likelihood of a trust response."

…and this is particularly important, when thinking about tone:

"You can’t fake trust. Trust either is or it isn’t. The very definition and reality of trust implies its genuine status. Words not backed by reality are meaningless. A message that sounds “trusting” but is not backed by the trustworthy action serves only to emphasize how untrustworthy the business really is."
