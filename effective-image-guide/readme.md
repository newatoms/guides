# Sciencing the $@%* out of images

When used correctly, effective visuals are extremely powerful to communicate an appropriate message. Let's look at some of the science behind visual content and what makes an image effective.

## First off: Why visual content is so important

Here are some telling stats as researched by [Buffer's](https://buffer.com/)  [Kevan Lee](https://blog.bufferapp.com/author/kevanlee) on just how big visual content has become and how it’s changing the way we all approach marketing:

**63% of social media is made up of images.** That means nearly two-thirds of the updates you see on social media are visual content, according to a [Citrix report](http://www.slideshare.net/citrix/citrix-mobileusage) from 2014.


**Nearly half of all Internet users have re-posted a photo or video they found online.** An equally intriguing stat from the same [2013 Pew Research Study](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media//Files/Reports/2013/PIP_Photos%20and%20videos%20online_102813.pdf) is that 54% of all Internet users have posted an original photo or video that they personally have created.

**Content with relevant images gets 94% more views than content without.** This often-cited visual content stat is evidence that visuals have been vital to online success for some time. The [original study from content platform Skyword](http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/enterprise-marketing/skyword-study-add-images-to-improve-content-performance/) came out in 2011. 94% equates to almost double the views, and the boost is noticed across all topics and categories.

**Images are the No. 1 most important factor in optimal social media content.** This is according to an [ongoing research survey](https://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/04/29/optimizing-social-media-content/?utm_content=buffer91ea2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) conducted by Software Advice and Adobe. More than 80% of survey respondents pointed to images being “Very Important” or “Important” for their marketing optimization on social. The runners up in terms of importance were hashtags and usernames.

## What makes an effective, relevant image?

There are a number of interesting scientific and psychological explanations for why certain images resonate with people and others don't:

* **Appeal**

Appeal refers to the natural attraction towards visual content, and the way it succeeds even in a short attention span. We might not be able to explain why we love a beautiful design because our conscious thought hasn’t yet caught up with our subconscious. Visceral reactions are some of the strongest connections we can make to visual content. They occur from the part of the brain that is also related to our survival instincts, which means that the reaction may be more direct and intense.

Visual content needs somehow to indicate the emotion for which it aims, either with the colors, the subject, or even with associations that lead to an easier connection which can elicit the right feeling (safety, food, positivity, love...).

* **Comprehension**

Comprehension is linked to the way our brains translate data to simplify it. It has been observed that 90% of the information sent to our brains is visual. with our brains responding to it 60,000 faster than they do for text.

Thus, our brains need a visual representation to process information faster and create a connection between the visual object and its concept. It’s impressive how the visual perception in our brain makes such a complex task easy and this could also be the scientific reason why an “image is worth a thousand words.”

* **Retention**

Retention is related to the memorable experience that visual content tends to create. There are now [algorithms created by MIT researchers](http://news.mit.edu/2015/csail-deep-learning-algorithm-predicts-photo-memorability-near-human-levels-1215) that predict photos' memorability at near-human levels. According to the algorithm, weird and counterintuitive images do well, as do conflict and suspense.

## Now what?
In a practical sense, according to [Haje Jan Kamps](https://medium.com/@Haje), "the best [images] are something people can relate to in one way or another, which usually means that the images need to tell part of the story." In other words, an image should provide a context for the reader. As the image-finder, it's up to you to decide what this context should be.
