> Goal of this guide: Helping you to create a pitch

# How to pitch
At New Atoms we do quite some pitching. We pitch ideas for articles to clients and we pitch our service to everyone who will listen. But what makes a good pitch?

## People buy who you are, not what you offer.

Super cliche, super true.  
The capability of the pitcher are as important as the pitch since every great idea needs to be executed in a great way.

Acording to the interwebs there are a few things that are most important to convey in your pitch.

Your get a maximum of 20 seconds to capture the attention of your audience.

Important things to convey throughout your pitch:
integrity: Are they really trying to achieve these goals or do they have alternative motives
passion: Are they enthusiastic enough to go beyond the obvious
Experience: Are you capable of achieving your set goals?
Knowledge: Do you understand what you are talking about
Skill: Are you capable of achieving the promise
Leader ship: Are you capable of creating and maintaining a team
Commitment: Are you reliable to continue even if things are not going as you want
Vision: Do you have an own view on things, a perspective that will help you get your own twist, leg for
Realism: Are you realistic or are you just spewing numbers to convince me
Coachable: Will you take advice from your investor, do you have the ability to listen.

While telling your story trying to convey these points it is important that the whole of your story follows the next points
It needs to have logical progression: If the story requires the listener is taken out of the flow to understand your story it is hard to follow you story and to keep your attention
I need to know the context of what i am hearing
It need to be about things i understand
You need outside validations: Make sure you are not the only one saying this.

From most of the other articles i have read on pitching 3 things seemed to be important:
What is the problem that you are solving
How will you solve this problem
Why are you capable of solving this problem
How are you going to make money on it.

Questions it arises:
Should our service not be focused on solving problems trough blogposts?
The user would give us up to three problems they are trying to solve with their company that we would also solve with our communication. Then we could just pick a problem, link them to the subjects, things that sets them apart and perspective to write articles.

Hypo
In order to sell the pitch in a written form
The reader needs to want to read the pitch and understand the value the pitch has for both the company and the blog it will be on.


Def of done
A first sentence that compels the reader to read the pitch.
Present the context.
Present the problem. (goal?)
Present the solution.
Summaries what the results will be of solving the problem in this way on this blog.
Summaries the boundaries we will set for ourselves in order to uphold the contract.




After some googling on how to pitch for an editor as a freelancer i found one point that really spoke to me.

Know who and what you are pitching for
Your pitch should elaborate why it fits the outlet and how it achieves the goal of the outlet
This way it is clear for the editor what place it will have within the blog and how it will help the entirety of the blog, website and company achieve their goal.

I found this ted talk from 2007 https://www.ted.com/talks/david_s_rose_on_pitching_to_vcs#t-610251 about pitching for investors.

The most important points that where made:

People invest in you as much as they are investing in your ideas.
