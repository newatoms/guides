# How to write well

## Explain the content of the article

We are trained to filter information very efficiently and are always thinking about how to best spend our valuable time. Consequently, we want to know beforehand that the time we spend on an activity will be rewarded. You should, therefore, grab the attention of the reader very early on. Only once interest has been piqued can you be sure that the reader will want to devote attention to the rest of the article, which will lead to a gratifying reading experience, as promised.

## Guide the reader through your thought process

You have a lot of knowledge that most readers don't 💾. While explaining something, then, you should always guide the reader through your whole thought process. There are no shortcuts. Use supporting facts, descriptions, and examples to clarify your ideas. Explain everything the reader needs to know but nothing more—too much information is off-putting. The **article should be as concise as possible**. This is difficult, so take your time! 🕗

Information in your brain seems logically connected, but to the reader these connections are not always as clear 😁. Writing is very different from conversing in that way. Think about transitions in conversations: these happen naturally but are very chaotic. It's rare that thought processes get fully explained or that the conversation stays on the same topic for longer than a few minutes (discussions aside). Ensure readers can follow the connections you make between ideas by explaining those relationships.

## Structure of the article

In the beginning of the article, give a preview of what the article contains while keeping your goal in mind. Do you want to convince the reader of something? Do you want to enthuse him/her? Do you want to explain a difficult concept? Do you want to amuse the reader? Each paragraph should bring you closer to this goal. This can be achieved by using different [types of paragraphs](http://patternbasedwriting.com/elementary_writing_success/paragraph-examples/), for example by explaining, sketching a scenario, convincing, showing contrast, stating a problem etc.

The order of the paragraphs is similar to the order of your thought process 💭– start by posing a question or making a bold statement. The following paragraphs should be used to build a convincing story to answer the question or convince the reader that your statements are correct.

> Always keep the goal in mind and explain your thought process throughout the article


## Structure of paragraphs

Most paragraphs expand on the information offered in an earlier paragraph. You should make sure the last sentence in one paragraph smoothly [transitions](../transitions/readme.md) to the next paragraph.
Each paragraph should add a unique point but it doesn't have to make sense on its own. Try to reach a conclusion at the end of the paragraph which places the information in the paragraph into the bigger whole.

## Structure of sentences

Reading short sentences is far easier than reading long sentences. Your short-term memory can only store a few concepts at the same time. Therefore, while reading long sentences, readers often forget the topics that were discussed in the beginning of the sentence by the time they reach the end. They'll have to read it multiple times to understand the sentence.

> Do: Write short sentences. This keeps things clear for your reader. They will like you.

> Don't: Write sentences that, if the reader is inclined to do so, elaborate on multiple topics, such as unborn babies and their resemblance to unicorns (which apparently people like to invest in) and thus leave the reader wondering what the hell is going on. (So yeah, how's that for a long stupid sentence?)

Just like paragraphs, sentences should follow each other in a natural way by using [sentence transitions](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/Transitions.html).

> Do: The child carried a balloon. The balloon popped open and out flew a flock of blackbirds.

>Don't: The child carried a balloon. Out flew a flock of blackbirds.

There are, of course, exceptions to making short sentences. If the reader is effectively guided through the idea and proper punctuation is used, multiple sub-sentences about a cohesive topic are acceptable.

## Write in active sentences

Always write in an active writing style. [Other styles can be effective](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/CCS_activevoice.html), but it's really difficult to do well.

> Do: An active writing style leads to a nice reading experience.

> Don't: A nice reading experience will be reached when the writing has been written in an active style.

## Choice of words

Avoid scarcely-used words unless there is no substitution. In this case, always explain the word. In most cases, however, complex things can and should be expressed simply.

## Seduce the reader

Readers don't only want to be informed. They want to be seduced by you. When this is done effectively the reader will memorise the content better. Let's get more practical, shall we?

* **Create attractive headings**. [Effective headings](../compose-great-headings/readme.md) form a balance between telling people why they should read it and creating curiosity (don't give away all!).
* **Talk to your reader like it's your best friend.** Ask questions and use the word *you*.
* **Empathise with your reader’s feelings.** Where is he/she struggling with. Sketch these scenarios.
* **Dare to be** an "authority", but **vulnerable** at the same time.
* It's important to provide a beautiful promise (Do keep it though!) in the beginning, **give people the feeling that they have to read your post.**
* In a blog post, **you only have words** to attract attention and convey emotion. That’s why you need to **turn up your passion and choose more powerful words**: *Instead of dull, use mind-numbingly dull. Instead of pleased, use delighted. Instead of beautiful, use gorgeous.*  
* Don't be too afraid of a little laugh once in a while.
* Sweep them of their feet and help them up again.

Be sure to keep the reader you are writing for in mind. There should be a healthy balance between informing and seducing.

## Find a suitable ending

Don't leave the reader hanging at the end. In the final paragraph, hook the reader with something that makes him/her crave for more. Bring the reader back to the goal of the article. If you posed a question, make sure that question has been thoroughly investigated. If you made a statement, make sure you summarize the various arguments you discussed along the way. Finally, find a way to spark the interest of the reader that leaves them with some food for thought :fried_shrimp:.

## Re-read your piece!

It's impossible to write a nice piece in a single go. Give yourself some space from your work and come back to it a little later. Always check for these aspects:

* Does everything support the goal of the text?
* Is the thought process clear?
* Does the structure of the article, paragraphs and sentences flow?
* Are sentences concise?
* Are sentences in an active style?
* Have difficult words been explained?
* Is there a tasty ending?
