# How to write well

## Explain the content of the article

People are trained to filter information very efficiently and are always thinking about how to best spend their valuable time. We want to know beforehand why we spend time on an activity. You should, therefore, grab the attention of the reader very early on. Only once interest has been piqued can you be sure that the reader will want to devote attention to the rest of the article, which will lead to a relevant reading experience. 

You make a promise to the reader in the beginning of the article; be sure to fulfill that promise and offer a nice ride towards it!

## Guide the reader through your thought process

> Explain ideas and connections between ideas

You have a lot of knowledge that most readers don't 💾. While explaining something you should therefore always guide the reader through your whole thought process. There are no shortcuts. At the same time, you don't want to share all your knowledge at once. Add facts, descriptions, and examples to guide the reader.
Explain everything the reader needs to know but nothing more, the **article should be as small as possible**. This is difficult so take your time! 🕗

Information in your brain is, hopefully 😁, somewhat ordered. Make sure readers can follow your connections between information by explaining how you feel that they are connected.

 > Writing is very different from conversing. Think about transitions in conversations. These happen naturally but are very chaotic. It's sparse that thought processes get fully explained or that the conversation stays with the same topic for longer than a few minutes (discussions aside).

## Sructure of the article

Explain in the beginning of the article what you will do in the rest of the article. Do you want to convince the reader of something? Do want to enthuse him/her? Do want to explain a difficult concept? Do you want to amuse the reader?
Each paragraph should add to obtaining this goal. This can be done by different [types of paragraphs](http://patternbasedwriting.com/elementary_writing_success/paragraph-examples/), for example by explaining, sketching a scenario, convincing, showing contrast, stating a problem etc.

The order of the paragraphs is similar to the order of your thought process 💭; start with explaining concepts and state a questions or make bold statements. The following paragraphs should be used to build a convincing story to answer the question or convince the reader that your statements are correct.

> Remind the reader of the goal and the thinking steps towards answering the question throughout the article!


## Structure of paragraphs

Most paragraphs expand on the information offered in an earlier paragraph. You should therefore build [transitions](../transitions/) between paragraphs.
Each paragraph should add a unique point but they don't have to make sense on their own. Try to reach a conclusion at the end of the paragraph which places the information in the paragraph into the bigger whole.

## Structure of sentences

Reading short sentences is far easier than reading long sentences. Your short term memory can only store a few concepts at the same time. Therefore while reading long sentences, readers often forget the topics that were discussed in the beginning of the sentence when they reach the end. They'll have to read it multiple times to understand the point that was made with the sentence.

> Only write long sentences with multiple subsentences when the the sentence is about one topic and the reader is guided through the steps in a very clear way.

Just like paragraphs sentences should follow each other in a natural way. Build [sentence transitions](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/Transitions.html) between your sentences. It also often helps to start a sentence with the concept you ended the sentence before it with.

" ... build transitions between paragraphs.

## Write in active sentences

Always write in an active writing style. [Other styles can have function](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/CCS_activevoice.html) but it's really difficult to do it well.

> Do: An active writing style leads to a nice reading experience.

> Don't: A nice reading experience will be reach when the writing style has been written in an active style.

## Choice of words

Only use scarcely used words when there is no substitution. Always explain the word.

## Reread your piece!

It's impossible to write a nice piece in a single go. Always check for these aspects:

* Is the thought process clear?
* Are sentences in an active style?
* Are sentence concise?
* Have difficult words been explained?
* Are there clear transitions between paragraphs and between sentences?
* Is there any redundant or duplicate information that can be removed?
