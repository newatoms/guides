# What this guide is:

This is the beginning of the post.press style guide for our own work including our website and publication. The joy of what we do and how we do it, means we’re going to keep this document alive and update it. Yes? Yes. OK, here is what is in the guide:

- who we are
- two tones we use
- practical dos and don'ts
- spelling and grammar resources
- glossary
- quick reminder
- elements we can refine as we go

## Who we are:

We are positioning ourselves as an Agile Editorial Team. This is a new idea and we want to explain it and offer our services to people. The goal of our writing is to introduce ourselves, explain what we do and how we do it, and answer our potential client's questions as to why we are the team for them.


## Two tones:

We are going to use the same values, grammar, key words, and spelling across both sites, but the tone for website and tone for publication will be different. This is because they have different audiences, with different audience needs.

### Tone for web:
Words to get you going: Clear, honest, concise, thoughtful, friendly, professional, sincere, collaborative, forward-thinking

Bear in mind that this is probably where we’ll send prospective clients (Directors and CEOs, communication personnel, project managers, marketing departments), but also where we outline our proposition. They’ll want to know who we are, what we do and why they’d use us. The best way to get the right tone, is to imagine you’re continuing a conversation with them on the phone. You’d be polite, but still personable. We’re looking for clarity over entertainment. This will build trust in us as a team.

### Tone for publication:
Words to get you going: Enthusiastic, humourous, fascinating, thoughtful, intelligent, opinionated, experimental, cutting-edge, honest, personality

The publication should appeal to people in the creative sphere and build a buzz around our activities. We are trailblazing a new way of working in a notoriously haphazard business. They probably want to know how and why we’re doing that and if we’re managing and what we're interested in. Also remember that we’re proving our own skills here - at the moment this is where our content is!

## Practical Dos and Don’ts:

**Do** read your writing out loud - is this how you would talk to a client? Is this how you’d talk to a friend?
**Do** exchange any jargon for plain language
**Do** explain technical terms before you use them - but feel free to use them where necessary
**Do** write in short sentences. Can you replace an ‘and’ with a ‘.’?
**Do** respect your audience, use their language
**Do** think about the letter ‘F’ - Web-user eye-tracking studies show that people tend to ‘read’ a webpage in an ‘F’ shape pattern. They look across the top, then down the side, reading further across when they find what they need. What this means is: put the the most important information first. So we talk a lot about ‘front-loading’ sub-headings, titles and bullet points.
**Do** be specific about what post.press does that others don’t

**Don’t** try and be funny - it’ll happen naturally
**Don’t** use double negatives
**Don’t** assume your audience knows everything - teach them something, enlighten them
**Don’t** use too much slang - it dates
**Don’t** worry about length, just tell a good story or get to the point
**Don’t** swear just yet

## Resources:

These are inarguable and will make certain basic elements consistent across all our writing.
**Spelling:** use O.E.D - http://www.oed.com/
**Grammar:** use Guardian - https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a
**Glossary:** use our own [guide](../glossary)

## Sum up:

Clarity over Entertainment
Respect over formality
Personablity over humour
Thoughtful over clever
Explanations over sales-pitches
Converstaional over cute
