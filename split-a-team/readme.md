Goal: A step by step walkthrough of splitting a team and creating two new ones.

# How to split a team

Our company is growing. All of our teams grow naturally by hiring new people. Ideally a team is between 5 and 10 people. So what happens if a team gets too big? It is devided, like natural cells divide.

Depicted is the meeting that happens when two teams divide.

## The division

Dividing a team happens along the developer classes. Every team needs all six roles to function. One person might need to take two classes but only if they are comfortable doing so.

All posessions need to be split, as well as all the products the teams are responsible for.

The division takes a whole day of plenary work.

## Tale of 2 new teams

Both teams are now new teams, the old one falls into disuse.

1. Choose a new team name (none of the teams can choose the old one, or one that previously existed).
2. Lay out a shared strategy for all products the team has assigned to it.
3. Make sure the workplaces are in order and the workplace budget can get assigned as required by everyone in the team.
4. Create a team in the Interface and a channel for your team in Slack.

And, GO!
