> **The goal of this guide:** Explain how you can enable automated services to communicate with Firebase

# Two types of automatic services communicate with Firebase

[CircleCi](https://circleci.com/) is a [continous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and [build automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation) service that will run tests on your code. This ranges from checking whether running the script returns an error to running all custom tests of the script. 

Bots listen to events and perform an action based on the type of event. For example, a bot can listen to whether something was added to a Firebase Collection and can notice a specific user of that change.
> we currently use a bot to push a message to slack when a client adds a message to a conversation on the interface

## Difference between a bot and circle in communicating with Firebase
Bots use the firebase secret. Go to the firebaseio url of your database and go to secrets.

CircleCi needs a token, not a secret!

### Generate a token for CircleCi:
In the folder of the repository you want to deploy there is a circle.yml file.
In it you will find the token name CircleCi wiÌ¨ll use when deploying.
Remember the token name (e.g. FIREBASE_TOKEN_READY) of the branch you want to deploy to e.g.:
```
--firebase repository-name --token $FIREBASE_TOKEN_READY
```


In your terminal:
- npm install -g firebase-tools
- firebase login (this will open a browser window to Github)
- firebase prefs:token
- receive a token.


Open your browser and go to the relevant repository in your [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/) account.
In the right-top corner you'll see project settings.
In Project settings you have environment variables.

Fill in the token name that is in your circly.yml: e.g. FIREBASE_TOKEN_READY
Fill in the token that you received in your terminal
