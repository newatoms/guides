> Goal of this guide: to understand how paragraph length affects the readability of a story

## The paragraph conundrum

A paragraph is supposed to be a neat little idea-bundle, yet "ideas [are] difficult to package and unlikely to remain in their allotted places. How big or small is an idea? What about an idea within an idea? Ultimately, a paragraph is complete when you decide it is" ([Daily Writing Tips](http://www.dailywritingtips.com/how-long-should-a-paragraph-be/)). Because ideas are slippery, it's difficult to science a paragraph.

## What can we do?

[Mignon Fogarty](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl), aka Grammar Girl, has written a [nice little guide](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/whats-the-rule-about-paragraph-length) to paragraphs, of which the following points are really solid and relevant to us:

* Paragraphs represent ideas, and ideas come in many sizes.
* The most important point should be at the beginning of a paragraph—often, that point is called a [topic sentence](http://grammar.about.com/od/tz/g/topicsenterm.htm)—and you use the rest of the paragraph to develop the point further.
* An average paragraph length is of 100 to 200 words, but good writers treat this as a suggestion and not a hard-and-fast rule.
* It’s important to mix up your paragraph length for the same reason you mix up your sentence structure: to keep your reader’s eyes from glazing over.
* Besides signaling a shift to a new idea, writers can use paragraph breaks to emphasize a point, to indicate a shift in time or place, or simply to break up text that looks too dense.
* You should keep in mind how and where your audience will read your writing (for example, journalistic writing has traditionally favored short paragraphs because print newspaper columns are narrow, which can make even short paragraphs seem long).
* Based on the minuscule amount of time an online reader spends before deciding whether to read an article (or not), the [*Yahoo! Style Guide*](https://books.google.nl/books?id=Z2m9AG-Y2lQC&pg=PT38&lpg=PT38&dq=Yahoo!+Style+Guide+paragraph+length&source=bl&ots=s-0Nz50S7h&sig=XKuEaM9K97kwXWvQiWkP9MKiz3A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinz_W70LvMAhXHAxoKHbVZDKYQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=Yahoo!%20Style%20Guide%20paragraph%20length&f=false) adds, “Keep paragraphs short. Two to three sentences is often enough".
* A short, one-line paragraph will instantly grab your reader’s attention.
* Don’t be afraid to vary your paragraph length as necessary to keep your readers interested, add emphasis, and achieve your desired pace and flow.
