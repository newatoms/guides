# How to look premium

So, you have set up an awesome service and you are ready to take it to the market. After extensive research, you know you have more to offer than much of the competition. Therefore the pricing is set in a higher segment. Yes, you are a premium service, spending much time and effort on your product, and your clients will have to pay for that. But how to convince them it's worth their money? Here's a few good points to get started, found in [this instructive article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217176) by entrepreuner.com.

1. Help clients understand why the price is higher: highlight your unique features. If you know how competitors are undercutting prices and feel the competitors' lower cost equates to poorer quality or service, explain this difference.
2. Go the extra mile. Show clients that their trust is appreciated by choosing you over other cheaper options. Not just by being friendly, but by for example delivering a bottle of wine.
3. Stick to your price, even when times are tough. Otherwise you will not generate enough cash flow to maintain your high quality service.
4. Milestone financial stability in your service – otherwise you’re too much of a risk.

## Get the looks

You can highlight your unique features until the cows come home – if they are not communicated in a convincing way, all effort goes to waste. This starts with clear and good writing (see this [guide on how to write well](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/writing-guide)), but doesn't end there. It's also about looks. On your website or any other means of communication, make sure to present your features in an attractive way. A few ideas:
* [Add suiting pictures or illustrations](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/effective-image-guide) to clarify and brighten up your points.
* Keep your texts short and simple. This means that you get to the point as fast as you can, rather than writing entire essays. Ain't nobody got time for that.
* Try to focus on the benefits of the features, rather than the features itself. For example, you have made a state-of-the-art custom interface designed with this or that framework. Most people won't care about this - all they want to know is how that benefits them.
* Give separate features some visual space to breathe. This allows for the reader to let them sink in as he or she scrolls through your website.
* Last but not least: the cover has to match the book. Make sure to have a design that suits your premium service! Think about it as buying fancy clothes. You want the design of the store to reflect the value of the product you're buying. If Sacks would look like Primark, you'd feel conned when checking out the pricetags.

Now go and convince people of your value!
