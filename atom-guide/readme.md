> **Goal of this guide:** showing the basics of using Atom to start working with Atom in combination with github desktop.

# How to use text-editor [Atom](https://atom.io)

> Be reminded to the fact that you're not obligated to use Atom as your text editor. There are a lot of alternatives such as: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for programming and text or [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for only text.

Atom is a very handy plain text/code writer that is free of all the formatting of text opposed to programs such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Atom is however very customizable. It enables you to think more about the content you're writing and its structure than the design. You can use it for programming (HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.) or pure content development in [Markdown](../glossary/markdown.md).   

For example, what is called "italic" in Word is essentially "emphasized" in Atom, and what is called "bold" is simply "important". This enables designers to display "important" information in a way of their choosing. Some might choose to display it in bold, but others might change the color or the font size.

## Ready for some magic?

* Atom enables you to easily browse through folders without having to leave Atom and go to Finder(Mac).
* When writing in Markdown you can see a preview window.  
* Atom has a powerful find and replace function.

When working local you can use this text editor together with [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for a more seamless flow and even more magic. We use Atom together with Github to edit text and code; you can find our [Github guide here](../github-guide/readme.md). Github is our version control dictator, until now we can't live without it.


## Handy shortcuts

* **cmd+click**: create multiple selectors (not tight to Atom alone)
* **ctrl+tab**: switch tab
* **cmd+arrow**: select whole line (combine with shift to select)
* **fn+arrow**: move to end of document (combine with shift to select)
* **ctrl+shift+m**: Markdown preview
* **cmd+`**: shift between windows of the same application
* **ctrl+tab**: scroll through tabs in current window

## Packages and themes

You can also change the way Atom looks and behaves by installing packages and themes. Among other things, this can increase the readability of your text/code. Themes can change things like the background color of Atom. Packages will 'read' your text and do certain things based on certain rules. They can for example assign colors, display icons, remove redundant white spaces, automatically fill in line of code.. etc. Ask a team member what set of themes/packages we're using at the moment. These packages will make your live very easy!

Installing themes explained in a GIF, why not.
