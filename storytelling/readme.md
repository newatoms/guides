# How to tell the shit out of your story

Storytelling is a buzzword, and with good reason. It makes for exciting communication. If done well, it stimulates the imagination, creates anticipation and evokes emotions. 

When we write articles, we are not simply taking bits of information from everywhere and sandwiching them together. Who wants to devour an information sandwich? Though they are not fiction, journalistic pieces will still benefit immensely from the structure of storytelling. They will be more cohesive, understandable, interesting to read and they will add more value to the reader.

In this guide we collect the different elements of a good story, and a bunch of tips by other experts.

## These are the elements of a good story
The first and foremost thing you should do when devising a story is figure out **a central premise**.
We kindly refer you to the [premise guide](../formulate-a-premise/readme.md) to learn about the six elements: a situation, a protagonist, an objective, a conflict, a disaster, an opponent. It works wonders to get these straight before starting your story.
They are much like these other elements that are said to be crucial to good storytelling found in [this article](https://msu.edu/course/tc/842/SevenElements%20Story.htm):

* **Strong three-dimensional characters** who change over time
* **A confined space** - often referred to as a crucible
* **A protagonist** who is on some sort of quest
* **An antagonist** of some sort bent on stopping the hero
* **An arch in everything** - everything is getting better or worse
* **A conflict** - (check out the [narrative conflict guide](../formulate-narrative-conflict/readme.md))

## This is what Pixar's storytellers advise us

We found these helpful pointers in a [Ted Talk by Andrew Stanton (Pixar)](http://www.echostories.com/5-ted-talks-to-make-you-a-better-storyteller/).

#### Storytelling has guidelines, no hard rules
Point in case: Pixar moved away from many classic elements of Disney movies that were thought unmissable: songs, ‘i want’ moments, a happy village, a love story, a villain. And still managed to make incredibly successful stories. So don't pinpoint yourself to each tip in this article.

#### Give a promise at the beginning
This can be as simple as ‘once upon a time’ (makes you wonder), or ‘let me tell you a story, it will be worth your time’ (builds up anticipation).

#### Make your audience 'work for their meal' (but hide it well)
A lack of information draws us in, as it makes us curious. We want to find out about the unknown. Make the audience put things together.

#### Give characters a spine/single purpose
For example, think of Don Corleone in the Godfather: please his father. Or Marlin in Finding Nemo: prevent harm.

#### Well-told stories have a strong theme running through it
See [formulating a premise](../formulate-a-premise/readme.md).

#### Add change in the story
If stories are static, stories die.

#### Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty
Make people wonder about how something will add up in the short and long run. Do this by constructing honest conflicts, that make for doubt in what will be.

#### Use what you know and draw from that
Express values that you personally feel, and experiences that you had.

### We still write articles

[Here are some storytelling tips specific to journalism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/collegeofjournalism/entries/5a80ff34-859a-37da-bcac-1af9d247456a) from the BBC/Daniel Kahneman’s *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, notably:

 +>Our brains have an almost irresistible desire to turn disparate facts into a coherent story. “It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness.”
