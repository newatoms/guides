# How to target the right audience

Knowing who a website’s visitors are (or will be) is crucial for designers and copywriters to know, because it helps us make all of the decisions that will ultimately comprise the website we deliver.

This means stepping outside of our role as writers and designers and putting on a marketer’s cap, because ultimately that’s what this information is all about. Marketers focus on helping companies *communicate effectively with their customers*, and that’s exactly what a successful website does.

Here are a few helpful things the interwebs say about understanding your audience:

> When it comes to identifying the needs and demands of the actual target audience, an effective kind of research will provide the required deliverable in a sufficient manner. This type of research should focus on these attributes such as preferences, behaviors, selection and trait as all these attributes are specifically linked with the target audiences.

> Looking at the competition can be a great way to kickstart the creative process. Which websites are at the top in your milestone’s field? Are they using similar layouts or colors? Do they adhere to similar styles or seem to cater visually to the same demographics?

> Understanding your audience is about finding out as much as possible about the people behind the numbers including their social and cultural situations, media consumption, likes, dislikes and needs.

> I always start with research, not in the library or out on the field but with a client survey and my best friend – Google. I ask questions to find out who my client is, what they do, who’s their competition and how they want to be perceived. Then I google their competition and see what I’m stacked up against.

> Next, I create personas for different visitors of the site. This can be fun! At Web Ascender, we always use characters from our favorite TV shows. As a team we determine their age, job title, gender, education and how the persona will be interacting with the website. It might be necessary to create several personas, because your target audience will most likely be a group of different people.

***Every single internet reference to this topic states how important it is to research who your target audience is.*** This can be done by thinking about the consistent qualities of existing clients or going to meet-ups and chatting with different types of people in order to understand their needs.
