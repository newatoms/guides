> Goal: Explain what it means to be a developer at New Atoms

# How to be a Developer

At New Atoms, we work in teams because we think better things are made together. Our teams behave as if they are one entity.

## Why do we work together?

* It‚Äôs more fun
* It‚Äôs less stressful; your team has got your back
* We share responsibilities
* It isn‚Äôt a problem when someone is not there; you can go on holiday üçπ
* We combine our skills and talents
* We can make better things this way

## What is the job of a team member?

As a team member, your job is not to make the best things or do the most work. It's to make the whole team as productive as possible.

By *productive* we do not mean to produce as much as possible in as little time as possible, whatever the cost. By *productive* we mean teams and their members have the proper environment and stimulation to do the best and most they can for as long as possible.

To do this, you‚Äôll have to use all the skills you have‚Äîwhatever they are and from wherever they come‚Äîand learn new ones. You‚Äôll have to be very aware of how everyone on your team is doing. And you‚Äôll need to be extra aware of how you are doing.

It's your job to add as much value as possible to what the team does, even if this means doing something you‚Äôve never done before. This could also mean getting re-energised by going on vacation to the tropics üèù.

## The 6 roles

The roles we've defined aren‚Äôt necessarily jobs as such. They are descriptions of the key roles in any complex creative development process. They are labels that help us figure out what kind of skills we have or miss in a team.

Every team member takes one of these roles according to their abilities. They are flexible and you can move among them, but as long as you have this role, you will have to live it:

* [Content Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/ready/internal/jobs/content.md)
* [Experience Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/ready/internal/jobs/experience.md)
* [Business Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/ready/internal/jobs/business.md)
* [Operations Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/ready/internal/jobs/operations.md)
* [Technical Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/ready/internal/jobs/technical.md)
* [Product Developer](https://github.com/newatoms/newatoms/blob/ready/internal/jobs/product.md)

Whoever has one of these roles is the representative of that field within that team. They are responsible for all the things that fall under their role. This doesn't mean they should only do what comes with their role, rather that they are responsible for that those things are and can be done.

A team needs all 6 of these roles to be fully functional.

## What does this mean?

The roles give developers differing perspectives and ownership. This enables developers to focus on a certain aspect and specialise in that. A developer is never solely personally responsible for [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) that "belong" to their developer role, the team is at a whole, however he is responsible for making sure his 'department' progresses as well as being a "thought leader" for the team on the topic.

For example: if a client wants to add something to a produced article, the conclusions drawn from this request can be different depending on your perspective as a certain developer:
* Was there anything wrong with the content? [Content Developer]
* How do we make sure that know about these things beforehand in the future? [Product Developer]
* How, if applicable, can the company structurally integrate this feedback into the production process? [Operations Developer]
* What effect will ignoring the request have on the relationship with the costumer? [Business Developer]
* How can we optimise the experience of giving feedback? [Experience Developer]
