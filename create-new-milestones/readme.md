# How to create a new milestone

So you have an amazing idea that would benefit the client, or New Atoms to the moon and back? Great. Let's make a new [milestone](../glossary/milestone.md).

### Get started
To prevent our workflow from slowing down, there is no need to vote in [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) for making new milestones.
Instead, you can make a new milestone on your own accord.

To do so, make a new folder in the milestones folder of the relevant [repository](../glossary/repository.md). Keep the folder name as short possible, yet descriptive. So rather than 'how-to-make-a-new-milestone', call it 'new-milestones'. To this folder you add a) title.txt for the title of your milestone and b) pitch.md, in which you put the description of you milestone.

### Fill in the blanks (and give them proper thought)
A new milestone always has a Goal, [Definition of Done](define-done.md), Proposed Methods and Motivation. Take some time to consider these carefully. The clearer you describe your milestone, the better the results will be.

### Get it reviewed
Finished? Awesome! To get it reviewed, simply add it to the Inbox of the connected product. Then notify the [product developer](../glossary/product-developer.md) to have it reviewed. If necessary, she/he will give you feedback. Once corrected into a  a valuable and reachable milestone, it will move to the Commission stage. Production will start once the product developer thinks it has enough priority. That could be the next day, or the next year.

### Make some achievables
As soon as your milestone was reviewed, you can start making achievables. A low-effort way to get started is to look at your definition of done, and use this as easy guidance.
