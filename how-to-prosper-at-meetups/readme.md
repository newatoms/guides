# How to prosper at meetups

Listen to the person. Try to find something to talk about in which you are genuinely interested (find common ground). They will inadvertently ask what you are doing.

## General tips:
- Perfectly fine to listen to a group talk and only minutes later say something. No value in introducing yourself when entering a group.
- Be engaged by what is happening (the talk, the people around you, the location). These are all things you automatically share with all the other people that are there.
- Keep it simple. People will try to help you help them understand it, but thereby often make your job more difficult. Try to explain it in bit sized pieces (instead of beginning top meta level and slowly traveling down)
- Don’t make why you’re there about selling something, you are mostly interested in the event and the story of the other party.
- Learn
- Don’t look at your mobile phone. People won’t approach you and you will give a negative vibe.
- Don't have 2 to 1 conversations. This can feel like an interrogation and speaking as a team to more people on an evening is generally more worthwhile for everybody involved.
- People won't mind you joining them, even if they are in a deep conversation.
- Don't feel obliged to keep having a conversation with people you can't find common ground with.
- Ask to explain the foundation of the conversation. Conversations are very fluid and it's usually difficult to explain the goal/idea of the conversation if you don't get the foundation. It likely helps them have a more focussed conversation as well. (don't interrupt the conversation immediately of course, try to see whether you can figure it out on your own first)
- If you don't find the topic interesting, try to learn why the other party finds it interesting. It might be that you can expand your horizon! Don't stay to long with annoying people though ;)
- Be honest! Nobody expects you to be an expert at everything. Your experience in other fields, or your view as a novice on the field, can be very interesting to other people.


## So you're in a conversation about something you do, now what?
Keep it simple

Give a relevant example, for example: explain content marketing by comparing two kinds of meetups:
* Somebody lists for which companies they did projects and how well they did those projects.
* Somebody explains how a mechanism with which they solved a problem* works OR teaches you how to code for free.
The one is selling, the other content marketing. People will have experienced the difference.
Give an example of solving a problem the goal oriented vs the solution oriented way.

However, since you've already been having a conversation with the person there is likely a more personalized way to explain it.

Revolve the conversation around the concept of content marketing instead of how their content marketing is at the moment. You will automatically approach that topic since they will be naturally inclined to share their situation.
