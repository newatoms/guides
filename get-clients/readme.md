> Goal of this guide: Helping you with direct customer acquisition for Newatoms services

# Getting paying customers

Just like every other company, we need to sell our services in order to be sustainable. In this guide we will only discuss direct customer acquisition. In our [communication guide](communication-guide) you can read about our indirect communication philosophy.

## The two ways to acquire customers

There are only two ways you can convince people to use your product of service. By convincing a specific person, or indirectly trough your general communication. With your general communication you can have a potentially infinite reach, but have very little control over who you reach.

The main difference between the two is that direct customer acquisition take more effort per client but can be done with very little means, while acquiring customers trough your general communication is a lot more effective, it requires you to actually have a form of communication, which takes a lot of effort and money to build.
