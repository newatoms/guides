> Goal of this guide: Helping you with direct customer acquisition for Newatoms services

# Getting paying customers

Just like every other company, we need to sell our services in order to be sustainable. In this guide we will only discuss direct customer acquisition. In our [communication guide](communication-guide) you can read about our indirect communication philosophy.

Even though we do need to sell our service, we only want to sell our services to people who can actually benefit from it. Working with a person who does not value your services for what it is extremely counterproductive since you need to keep convincing them of every step you take.

## The two ways to acquire customers

There are only two ways you can convince people to use your product of service. **By directly convincing a specific person**, or indirectly **trough your general communication**. With your general communication you can have a potentially infinite reach, but have very little control over who you reach.

The main difference between the two is that direct customer acquisition take more effort per client but can be done with very little means, while acquiring customers trough your general communication is a lot more effective, it requires you to actually have a form of communication, which takes a lot of effort and money to build.

## Direct customer acquisition

There are two types of direct customer acquisition. Contacting people directly that you think are suitable clients for your product that you have no personal connection with (called cold customer acquisition), and those with whom you have a direct or indirect relationship.

There is one super important thing to realize before we go on. You are speaking as a person on behalf of a company to a person on behalf of a company.

## How to sell your service

Sadly in most companies failure is punished harder than that success is rewarded. Because of this employees usually are motivated more by self preservation than success, meaning that they probably are not keen on taking risks for the company that can reflect poorly on themselves. What is good for the company is usually only interesting if it is also good for them personally. This can be by reflecting good on them, making their job easier or by eliminating risks.

Because of this it is at least as important to understand the person you are talking to, as the company they work for.

Selling the benefit of your service for the person you are talking to is more important in a sale that the effect it will have on the company as a whole.

### Understand who you need to talk to

Talking to the right person is probably the most important thing to make a sale.

A good way do this, is by understanding which person/function has the authority within the company to hire your service, and which person/function has the most to gain by hiring you service.

If you understand this, and it is not the same person, you need to determine who can help you the most. Sometimes a person within a company who has a personal interest for your service is a better entry point than the person who has the authority to hire your service but is less interested.

The easiest way of finding this out is by searching on a company and function with google and linkedIN.  When you have the names of the people within the functions, search with Facebook and google for personal details that you can use in you decision who you want to contact and how to talk to them.

### Formulating tangible examples

From my limited experience i have found that giving **tangible examples** that explain the added value of you service, in general and for the prospect in question, is usually the easiest way to sell your service no matter the medium you use or the  relationship you have with the prospect.

These tangible examples come in two Layers and can be figured out by answering the following questions.

**Bussiness Relevance for the prospect**
* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to your service
* What can you find out about your prospect that relates to the vision of your service
* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to you as a person.
* How does the vision your of your prospect relate to the vision of your service.
* Can you formulate a tangible example of how these two visions relate in a positive way

**Personal Relevance for the prospect**
* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to  your service
* What can you find out about your prospect that relates to the vision of your service
* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to you as a person.


## Direct customer acquisition by phone

Phone calls are by far the most efficient and scariest way of direct customer acquisition. The reason it is so effective (and scary), is the fact that it is just a conversation. You can use everything you learned by answering the questions above and use that information to steer the conversation in the direction that you want. While making a phone call it is super mega important to realize you are talking to a person, who has its own values, ambitions, hopes and dreams. Don't become a manipulative sales robot. Be a person and try to have some fun.

Oja, never ever EVER suggest that a person is only looking out for their own interest, always assume that they care for the company they work for, even though the success of the company might not be their primary goal.

When calling a person there are a few things that usually are important to discuss, most of the time in this order.

* Explain who you and what the gist is of what you do, formulated in the way it has the most added value to the person you are calling.
* Explain why you are calling this particular person.
* Ask what their experience is with doing what your service does, on their own.
* Explain/discuss how your service can improv things for both the company and the person you are talking to in relation to what they told you and what your could find on the interwebz.
* Always try to end you phonecall with an agreement and peferrable a deadline. 

### Tips and tricks

### How to reach the right person if you have no direct number

If you cant find a direct number to the person you are  trying to reach, call a different person of the company and ask for the person you are trying to reach. If you are calling some one else in order to reach your prospect keep the next points in mind, they might help you.

* Avoid receptions and help desks if possible, often their man task is to guard the employees against people who are trying to sell stuff.  
* The more certain you seem that you are asking for the right person, the more likely it is they will connect you. Often this means just asking to be connected with the person you are looking for.
* If the person cant be reached, ask for their direct number or extension.

### How to use your Personal connection

If your know the prospect directly or someone you know can introduce you to the prospect answers on the following questions will always help you sell your service.

* Do you have shared experiences and insights with the prospects
* How do these experiences and insights relate to the service you are trying to sell
* Can you formulate a tangible example of the added value of using your service that relates to your shared insights and experiences.
