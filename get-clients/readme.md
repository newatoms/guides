> Goal of this guide: Helping you with direct customer acquisition for Newatoms services

# Getting paying customers

Just like every other company, we need to sell our services in order to be sustainable. In this guide we will only discuss direct customer acquisition. In our [communication guide](communication-guide) you can read about our indirect communication philosophy.

Even though we do need to sell our service, we only want to sell our services to people who can actually benefit from it. Working with a person who does not value your services for what it is will require you to keep convincing them of every step you take, making it extremely counter productive.

## The two ways to acquire customers

There are two ways in which you can convince people to use your product of service. **By directly convincing a specific person**, or indirectly **trough your general communication**. With your general communication you can have a potentially infinite reach, but have very little control over who you reach.

The main difference between the two is that direct customer acquisition take more effort per client, but can be done with very little means. Acquiring customers trough your general communication is a lot more effective but requires you to actually have a form of communication, which takes a lot of effort and money to build.

## Direct customer acquisition

There are two types of direct customer acquisition. Contacting people directly that you think are suitable clients for your product that you have no personal connection with (called cold customer acquisition), and those with whom you have a direct or indirect relationship.

There is one super important thing to realize before we go on. You are speaking as a person on behalf of a company to a person on behalf of a company.

## How to sell your service

Sadly in most companies failure is punished harder than that success is rewarded. Because of this employees usually are motivated more by self preservation than success, meaning that they probably are not keen on taking risks for the company that can reflect poorly on themselves. What is good for the company is usually only interesting if it is also good for them personally. This can be by reflecting good on them, making their job easier or eliminating risks.

Because of this, it is at least as important to understand the person you are talking to, as the company they work for.

Selling the benefit of your service for the person you are talking to is usually more important in a sale that the effect it will have on the company as a whole.

### Understand who you need to talk to

Knowing who to talk to is half the work of selling your service.

A good way to figure out who you need to talk to is by understanding which person/function has the authority within the company to hire your service, and which person/function has the most to gain by hiring you service.

If you know this, and it is not the same person, you need to determine who can help you the most. Sometimes a person within a company who has a personal interest for your service is a better entry point than the person who has the authority to hire your service but is less interested.

The easiest way of finding this out is by searching on a company and function with google and linkedIN.  When you have the names of the people within the functions, search with Facebook and google for personal details that you can use in you decision who you want to contact and how to talk to them.

### Formulating tangible examples

From my limited experience I have found that giving **tangible examples** that explain the added value of you service, in general and for the prospect in question, is usually the easiest way to sell your service. No matter the medium you use or the  relationship you have with the prospect.

These tangible examples come in two Layers and can be figured out by answering the following questions.

The answers to these questions help you understand the added value for the customer and formulate a tangible example. By no means think you have to use all the answers while swooning your prospect, probably that will be a tad bit overwelming.  

**Bussiness Relevance for the prospect**

* What can you find out about the prospect/company that relates to your service.

* Can you formulate a tangible example of the added value of using your service for the prospect/company

* What can you find out about the vision of the prospect/company that relates to the vision of your service

* Can you formulate a tangible example of how these two visions relate in a positive way

**Personal Relevance for the prospect**

* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to  your service

* Can you formulate a tangible example of the added value of using your service for the prospect/person

* What can you find out about your prospect that relates to the vision of your service
* Can you formulate a tangible example of how these two visions relate in a positive way

* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to you as a person.

* Can you formulate a tangible example of the added value of using your service in relation to your similarities.


## Direct customer acquisition by phone

Phone calls are by far the most efficient (and scariest) way of direct customer acquisition. The reason it is so effective, is the fact that it is just a conversation. You can use everything you learned by answering the questions above and use that information to steer the conversation in the direction that you want.

While making a phone call it is super mega important to realize you are talking to a person, who has its own values, ambitions, hopes and dreams. Don't become a manipulative sales robot (asshole). Be a person and try to have some fun.

Oja, never ever EVER suggest that a person is only looking out for their own interest, always assume that they care for the company they work for, even though the success of the company might not be their primary goal.

When calling a person there are a few things that can be important to discuss.

* Explain who you and what the gist is of what you do, formulated in the way it has the most added value to the person you are calling.
* Explain why you are calling this particular person.
* Ask what their experience is with doing what your service does, on their own.
* Explain/discuss how your service can improve things for both the company and the person you are talking to. Formulate this so that it has a relation to what they told you and what your could find on the interwebz.
* Discuss what the next step will be and try to formulate a deadline (This helps you understand you position, makes the next step clear and forces the prospect to consider your service).

### Tips and Tricks

* don't ask yes questions that have a negative connotation
* don't ask questions which answers can and your conversation.
* Using the name of the person you are talking to can create a personal relevance.

### How to reach the right person if you have no direct number

If you cant find a direct number to the person you are  trying to reach, call a different person of the company and ask for the person you are trying to reach. If you are calling some one else in order to reach your prospect keep the next points in mind, they might help you.

* Avoid receptions and help desks if possible, often their man task is to guard the employees against people who are trying to sell stuff.  
* The more certain you seem that you are asking for the right person, the more likely it is they will connect you. Often this means just asking to be connected with the person you are looking for.
* If the person cant be reached, ask for their direct number or extension.


## Direct customer acquisition by email

In general I would strongly recommend against using email as your sole form of contact with your prospect. The main reason for this is that you never know if and when the email is read. Unless you can create necessity for the prospect in your email the chances are big that the receiver decides to look at your email later, and then forgets about it.

### Email as first contact

The world we live in is not a perfect one and sometimes this means you will have to do business trough email, or send an email before you can call some on.

If this is the case it is important to create relevance or even necessity for the reader to read and reply to your email. This can be done in the following ways.

* Make it clear that the email is specifically directed at your prospect. You do this to give the reader a sense of importance and make clear that this is not a mass email that can be ignored.
* Shortly explain who you are and who you work for.
* Shortly explain the gist of you service specified to the relevance it has to the prospect, both personally as professionally.
* If you do not have the phone number of the person in question, state what you want to discuss and suggest to do it trough phone or, if possible, in person.

### Email as follow up

When your write an email as a follow up to a phone conversation make sure too keep the following things in mind

* Quickly explain who you are and when you last spoke.
* Quickly summarize what you discussed  together on the phone, both the added value of your service and the conclusions you came to.
* Deliver what you promised to deliver on the phone, usually this is extra info, prizes, website links, portfolios etc. Do this in such a way that it is in line with your conversation with the prospect.
* If there has been set a goal and deadline summarize it in the email, if not try to formulate one.

### How to use your Personal connection

If your know the prospect directly or someone you know can introduce you to the prospect answers on the following questions will probably help you sell your service.

* Do you have shared experiences and insights with the prospects
* How do these experiences and insights relate to the service you are trying to sell
* Can you formulate a tangible example of the added value of using your service that relates to your shared insights and experiences.
