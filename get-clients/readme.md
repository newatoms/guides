> Goal of this guide: Helping you with direct customer acquisition for Newatoms services

# Getting paying customers

Just like every other company, we need to sell our services in order to be sustainable. In this guide we will only discuss direct customer acquisition. In our [communication guide](communication-guide) you can read about our indirect communication philosophy.

## The two ways to acquire customers

There are only two ways you can convince people to use your product of service. By directly convincing a specific person, or indirectly trough your general communication. With your general communication you can have a potentially infinite reach, but have very little control over who you reach.

The main difference between the two is that direct customer acquisition take more effort per client but can be done with very little means, while acquiring customers trough your general communication is a lot more effective, it requires you to actually have a form of communication, which takes a lot of effort and money to build.

## Direct customer acquisition

There are two types of direct customer acquisition. Contacting people directly that you think are suitable clients for your product that you have no personal connection with (called cold customer acquisition), and those with whom you have a direct or indirect relationship.

### How to sell your service

There is one super important thing to realize before we go on. You are speaking as a person on behalf of a company to a person on behalf of a company.

From my limited experience, tangible examples that explain the added value of you service, in general and the prospect in question, is usually the easiest way to sell your service no matter your relationship with the prospect.

Here are a few questions

**Relevance**
* Why is your service relevant for the prospect.
* What would be a favorable outcome could be for the prospect if they would hire using your service.
* Can you formulate a tangible example of the favorable outcome of using your service.

**Vision**
* How does the vision your prospect relate to the vision of your service.
* Can you formulate a tangible example of how these two visions relate in a positive way

**Personal stuff**
* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to your service
* What can you find out about your prospect that relates to the vision of your service
* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to you as a person.


### How to use your Personal connection

If your know the prospect directly or someone you know can introduce you to the prospect answers on the following questions will always help you sell your service.

* Do you have shared experiences and insights with the prospects
* How do these experiences and insights relate to the service you are trying to sell
* Can you formulate a tangible example of the added value of using your service that relates to your shared insights and experiences.
