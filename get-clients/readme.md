> Goal of this guide: to help you with direct customer acquisition for New Atoms services

# Getting paying customers

Just like every other company, we need to sell our services in order to be sustainable. In this guide we will only discuss direct customer acquisition. In our [communication guide](../communication-guide), you can read about our indirect communication philosophy.

Even though we do need to sell our services, we only want to sell our services to people who can actually benefit from them. Working with a person who does not value your services for what they are will require you to keep convincing them of every step you take, making the process extremely counter-productive.

Nothing suggested in this guide is a hard truth, and nothing should be blindly accepted as such. 

## Two ways to acquire customers

There are two ways in which you can convince people to use your product or service: by directly **convincing a specific person**, or indirectly **through your general communication**. With your general communication, you can have a potentially infinite reach but have very little control over who you reach.

The main difference between the two is that direct customer acquisition takes more effort per client but can be done with very little means. Acquiring customers through your general communication is a lot more effective but requires you to actually have a form of communication, which takes a lot of effort and money to build.

## Direct customer acquisition

There are two types of direct customer acquisition: contacting potential suitable clients directly that you have no personal connection with (called cold customer acquisition), and contacting those with whom you have a direct or indirect relationship.

*One super important thing to realize before we go on is that you are speaking as a person on behalf of a company to a person on behalf of a company.*

## How to sell your service

Sadly, in most companies, failure is punished more severely than success is rewarded. Because of this, employees are usually motivated more by self-preservation than success, meaning that they are probably not keen on taking risks for the company that could reflect poorly on themselves. What is good for the company is usually only interesting if it is also good for them, personally.

Because of this, it is at least as important to understand the person you are talking to as the company for which they work.

Selling the benefit of your service specifically to the person to whom you are talking is usually more important in a sale than the effect it will have on the company as a whole.

### Understand who you need to talk to

Knowing who to talk to is half the work of selling your service.

A good way to figure out who you need to talk to is by understanding which person/function holds the authority to hire your service within the company, and which person/function has the most to gain by hiring your service.

If you know this and it is not the same person, you need to determine who can help you the most. Sometimes a person within a company who has a personal interest for your service is a better entry point than the person who has the authority to hire your service but is less interested.

The easiest way to find this out is by searching a company and function with Google and LinkedIN.  When you have the names of the people within the functions, search with Facebook and Google for personal details that you can use to help you decide who you want to contact and how to speak to them.

### Formulating tangible examples

I have found that giving **tangible examples** that explain the added value of your service (in general and for the prospect in question) is usually the easiest way to sell your service, no matter the medium you use or the relationship you have with the prospect.

These tangible examples come in two layers and can be figured out by answering the following questions:


**Business Relevance for the prospect**

* What can you find out about the prospect/company that relates to your service?

* Can you formulate a tangible example of the value your service would add to the prospect/company?

* What can you find out about the vision of the prospect/company that relates to the vision of your service?

* Can you formulate a tangible example of how these two visions relate in a positive way?

**Personal Relevance for the prospect**

* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to your service?

* Can you formulate a tangible example of the value your service would add to the prospect/person's current situation?

* What can you find out about your prospect that relates to the vision of your service?

* Can you formulate a tangible example of how these two visions relate in a positive way?

* What can you find out about the prospect that relates to you as a person?

* Can you formulate a tangible example of the value your service would add in relation to your similarities?
 
The answers to these questions help you understand the added value for the customer and formulate a tangible example. By no means should you think it necessary to use all the answers while wooing your prospect—that would probably be a tad bit overwhelming.


## Direct customer acquisition by phone

Phone calls are by far the most efficient (and scariest) way of direct customer acquisition. The reason they are so effective is the fact that it's just a conversation. You can use everything you learned by answering the questions above and use that information to steer the conversation in the direction you want.

While making a phone call, it is super mega important to realize you are talking to a person who has her or his own values, ambitions, hopes and dreams. Don't become a manipulative sales robot (asshole). Be a person and try to have some fun.

Oh yeah, never ever EVER suggest that a person is only looking out for their own interest. Always assume that they care for the company they work for, even though the success of the company might not be their primary goal.

When calling a person, there are a few things that are important to discuss:

* Explain who you are and the gist of what you do, formulated in a way that has the most added value for the person you are calling.
* Find out if your call is convenient. If your prospect has no time to talk to you, ask to speak at another time that's better for them and follow up.
* Explain why you are calling this particular person.
* Ask what their experience is with doing what your service does, on their own.
* Explain/discuss how your service can improve things for both the company and the person to whom you are speaking. Formulate this so that it has a relationship to how they responded to the previous question and what you could find on the interwebz.
* Discuss what the next step will be and try to formulate a deadline (this helps you understand your position, makes the next step clear and forces the prospect to consider your service).

### Tips and Tricks while on the phone

* Try not to ask questions that have a negative connotation; formulate them in a positive way.
* Try not to ask questions whose answers can end your conversation.
* Using the name of the person to whom you are talking shows that you take them seriously and (sometimes) creates a personal relevance.
* Encourage the person on the line by making confirmative noises.
* Being enthusiastic can be a persuasive tool.
* Be yourself. If you can't make your prospect see the relevance of what you are doing, they might not be a good fit.
* Don't try to convince your prospect but make sure they see and understand possible positive outcomes.



### How to reach the right person if you have no direct number

If you cant find a direct number for the person you are trying to reach, call a different person in the company and ask for the person you are trying to reach. While doing this, keep the next points in mind—they might help you.

* Avoid receptions and help desks if possible. Often their main task is to guard the employees against people who are trying to sell stuff (just like you are).  
* The more certain you seem that you are asking for the right person, the more likely it is they will connect you. (Often this means just asking to be connected with the person you are looking for.)
* If the person can't be reached, ask for their direct number or extension so you do not have to go through this again.


## Direct customer acquisition by email

In general, I would strongly recommend against using email as your sole form of contact with your prospect. The main reason for this is that you never know if and when the email is read. Unless you can create necessity for the prospect in your email, the chances are great that the receiver decides to look at your email later, and then forgets about it.

### Email as first contact

The world we live in is not a perfect one and sometimes this means you will have to do business through email, or send an email before you can call someone.

If this is the case it is important to create relevance or even necessity for the reader to read and reply to your email. This can be done in the following ways:

* Make it clear that the email is specifically directed at your prospect. You do this to give the reader a sense of importance and make clear that this is not a mass email that can be ignored.
* Briefly explain who you are and who you work for.
* Briefly explain the gist of your service and how it is specifically relevant to the prospect, both personally and professionally.
* If you do not have the phone number of the person in question, state what you want to discuss and suggest to do it over phone, or if possible, in person.

### Email as follow-up

When your write an email as a follow-up to a phone conversation, make sure to keep the following things in mind:

* Quickly explain who you are and when you last spoke.
* Quickly summarize what you discussed together on the phone, both the added value of your service and the conclusions you came to.
* Deliver what you promised to deliver on the phone (this is usually extra info, prizes, website links, portfolios, etc.). Do this in such a way that it is in line with your previous conversation with the prospect.
* If there has been set a goal and deadline, summarize it in the email. If not, try to formulate one.

### How to use your personal connection

If your know the prospect directly or someone you know can introduce you to the prospect, answers to the following questions will probably help you sell your service:

* Do you have shared experiences and insights with the prospect?
* How do these experiences and insights relate to the service you are trying to sell?
* Can you formulate a tangible example of the value your service would add that relates to your shared insights and experiences?

## The end

There you have it, you officialy know more about direct customer aquisition than we do! One last note before you will start world domination: remember that you are a person with your own amazing traits and personality. Never put them aside in order to convice someone to hire your service. If you stay true to who you are, working with the people that hire you will be a lot more fun. You also don't have to pretend you're someone you're not, which is not as much fun as one would think.
