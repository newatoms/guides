# How to grab attention with your image thumbnail

While the scientific research backing the factoid "humans process images 60,000 times faster than text" seems to be elusive, there's no doubt that we learn much earlier on in life how to interpret images than we do with text.

While more abstract concepts and stories might still be better elucidated with text, the fact remains that when it comes to connecting with speed, graphic content has the upper hand. And in a busy place like the interwebs, connecting quickly with a potential reader is paramount.

## The Need for Speed
Enter the image thumbnail. As we put painstaking effort into crafting articles with the imagery to accompany, or a complex data visualisation, infographic, illustration or the like, it's easy to forget that many a time, it's the humble thumbnail that could determine whether that post gets seen at all.

Unless you were lucky enough to have visitors who were searching for the subject your article addresses, chances are their first point of contact will be somewhere in their social media or recommended reads. In this scenario, that little (usually) rectangle of pixels, nestled in with all the other things vying for attention, is your best chance of getting your article seen.

So how do we make the most of this little piece of real estate? Well, definitely check out [guide on effective images](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/effective-image-guide) for a start, but below are some tips specifically for the tiny thumbnail.

## 1. Contrast
Remember the context that your article is going to be presented in. Internet pages mostly have white or light backgrounds, and this is especially true of sites for content distributors.  Desaturated and washed out images are not going to work to stand out in this scenario.

## 2. Colours
While colours are not essential (provided there's adequate use of contrast), they can definitely be employed to make your image stand out more. Bright colours especially work, but should be used in moderation and strategically, with a balance of muted tones as too many clashing bright colours can look gaudy (unless, of course, that's exactly what you want to impart).

## 3. Humanise It
Because humans are a self-centred species, adding a human element often helps increase the interest in an image. Try to make effective use of this though - a celebrity face will carry more meaning than a nobody. If using an unrecognisable person, try to make sure it's clear what they represent.

## 4. Single Frame Storytelling
This doesn't mean trying to fit the entire message of the story in a thumbnail, after all you do want them to click through to find out more! Instead, try to think about how you can create some action or intrigue within that static frame. This could be with a dynamic action shot, or an element of surprise. It could even just feature a subject or setting from the post that you know your target audience is really interested in.

## 5. Work with the Headline
Your thumbnail will always be accompanied by the post title or headline. While writing a great headline is [a whole other topic we explore here](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/compose-great-headings), the pairing of the two can really be the killer combo that lands you reader. Together they could set the context for the main content; for example, a visual depiction of the problem the headline promises to solve in the post. Apart from supporting the headline, the image could even consciously go against it to make use of that element of surprise we discussed previously.
