# How to grab attention with your image thumbnail

While the scientific research backing the factoid "humans process images 60,000 times faster than text" seems to be elusive, there's no doubt that we learn much earlier on in life how to interpret images than we do with text.

While more abstract concepts and stories might still be better elucidated with text, the fact remains that when it comes to connecting with speed, graphic content has the upper hand. And in a busy place like the interwebs, connecting quickly with a potential reader is paramount.

## The Need for Speed
Enter the image thumbnail. As we put painstaking effort into crafting articles with the imagery to accompany, or a complex data visualisation, infographic, illustration or the like, it's easy to forget that many a time, it's the humble thumbnail that could determine whether that post gets seen at all.

Unless you were lucky enough to have visitors who were searching for the subject your article addresses, chances are their first point of contact will be somewhere in their social media or recommended reads. In this scenario, that little (usually) rectangle of pixels, nestled in with all the other things vying for attention, is your best chance of getting your article seen.

So how do we make the most of this little piece of real estate? Well, definitely check out [guide on effective images](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/tree/ready/effective-image-guide) for a start, but below are some tips specifically for the tiny thumbnail.
