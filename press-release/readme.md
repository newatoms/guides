# How to write a press release

To get publicity for something, it is a good idea to craft a press release.
A press release is a short story that quickly informs the journalist about the matters you seek publicity for. In this guide we will take New Atoms as a point of departure. [This wonderful article on the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/jul/14/how-to-write-press-release) and [this article on Hubspot](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht#sm.000ucb46j1c81d33w1227o0htwjfb) were extensively consulted.

## First things to consider

First, ask yourself: what is "new" in my story?

➡ New Atoms, a start-up for journalistic innovations, was founded

What is unexpected or in any way exciting about it?

➡ mission to revolutionize journalism / agile journalism / editorial teams "on demand" / get subscription-based content through an app / received Google funding

Will it be of interest to anyone outside our business?

➡ Yes, as it concerns many different kinds of businesses (journalism, communication, marketing, technology, startup life, etc.)

Will anyone care?

➡ Yes, based on the amount of unexpected/exciting things about it


## The first paragraph

It is important to grab the editor/journalists attention right away. Don't be too witty or smart, just be clear. An editor often only takes a few seconds to determine whether your story is worthy. Thus, summarize your story in the first paragraph. Consider the 5 W's: What, Where, Who, When, Why.

What

➡ the foundation of New Atoms, an early-stage news, journalism and research start-up

Where

➡ in Amsterdam

Who

➡ Boris van Hoytema, driven by his experiences in various media companies

Why

➡ to innovate journalism (by making it adaptable and scalable) / because journalism is stuck in irrelevant traditions

When

➡ this year

And a useful addition is How:

➡ By making journalism agile, enforcing collaboration, efficiency and sharing of knowledge

The first paragraph could thus read:

> AMSTERDAM — New Atoms is an early-stage news, journalism and research start-up that was founded earlier this year. Founder Boris van Hoytema set out to innovate journalism. In his past experiences in various media (such as BBC and VPRO) he saw that the profession is stuck in conservative traditions, unable to quickly adapt to vast technological developments. The solution New Atoms proposes is agile journalism, enforcing flexibility, effective collaboration and sharing of knowledge in an otherwise largely individualistic, rigid trade.

## The next paragraphs

The second and third paragraph are a good spot to elaborate. Use quotes to provide insight, rather than new information. Be critical to not include information that isn't absolutely vital.

> **The challenges of journalism**

> The main challenges journalism faces is a) not adapting to technological developments, consequently failing to meet peoples' needs, and b) being unable to grow, as this is very costly. Most research - apart from a small portion that ends up in the articles - does not get stored or shared and is therefore lost. This means that journalists don't benefit from one another's knowledge and experience, and do work others have already done. This seems like borderline lunacy in a world where information sharing is everyday's business.

> **The answer of New Atoms**

> "If news organisations didn't yet exist, what would we create?" Boris then wondered. The answer is a start-up that has collaboration at its core, marrying journalism with agile work methods. A start-up that allows news organisations to hire editorial teams whenever they need a bigger workforce, manageable through an online interface. These teams are made up of people with multidisciplinary skills. They simultaneously build upon articles, in quick goal-oriented iterations. Every little iteration a team member contributes adds value, together coalescing to form the whole. The ensuing articles are enriched with different viewpoints and knowledge.

> **The current state**

> The past few months New Atoms has worked out how to go about agile journalism, developing software that facilitates their workflow. Introducing their ideas to the journalistic world is next. In the mean time, New Atoms is funded by Digital News Initiative, a fund by Google to stimulate innovation in journalism. As they aim to be an organisation with a wide variety of services and projects, they also founded post.supply. Post.supply is a subscription service for companies that want to outsource their content creation. It makes this as hassle-free as possible by offering editorial teams that can be managed through an online interface. For more information, see http://www.post.supply.  

## Other things to keep in mind
* Add 'press release' or 'story idea' to your email subject, and be sure that the email subject tells the journalist exactly what the press release is about
* The piece should be no longer than 300 or 400 words.
* Use subheadings and when applicable bulletpoints
* Try to send the email to personal email addresses within an organisation, rather than general ones.
* Add a small paragraph on where and how it might fit, tailored to the publication you're pitching to


## Good luck!
