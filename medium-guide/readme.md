# How to publish to Medium

At New Atoms we write on our [New Atoms Medium Blog channel](https://medium.com/new-atoms-beta). We write about what we learn and what it's like to start a business. Every team member can pitch ideas for blogposts in the Slack channel: beta.

This guide is a quick tutorial about how to create a blogpost.
