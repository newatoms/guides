> *Goal of this guide:* Explain how to work with the achievable board in the interface and with achievables.

# How to use the achievable board

The main tool in our process is the achievable board. The board is the place where we keep track of our ideas, where they are in their lifecycle and who is working on what.

## The life of an achievable

From creation to going live, [achievables](../glossary/achievable.md) go through distinct phases, like growing up. On the board there is one column for every [phase](../glossary/phase.md) an achievable is in.

Through its life an achievable—and its little card—travels from left to right on the board.

The first phase is the *creation phase* and the last one is the ‘live’ phase, which is when the achievable has been achieved. It is out there in the world, out of our hands, more than often for others to see.

In every phase an achievable offers different kinds of actions you can perform on it. For instance in the ‘next’ phase you can assign an achievable to yourself and move it to *Production*. If you have an achievable assigned to yourself for review, it enables you to mark it as merged by moving it to the ‘ready’ phase.

At the top of every column on the board there is a description of what that phase is and what it means for the achievables.

## Some achievables are more important than others

Every idea we have is important. Every idea we have represents a need that someone has. Even ideas that are not relevant now might very well be relevant in the near or far future.

So if every achievable is important, how do we decide which ones we should do first?

For this there are two tools:

* The [product developer](../glossary/product-developer.md) is in charge of ordering the achievables in the backlog. It is his/her job to make sure the most important ones are at the top and the least important ones at the bottom. The product developer prioritises by adjusting the value/effort ratio.
* Everyone can mark an achievable as important. By doing this you let the product developer know that he/she should look at it first.
