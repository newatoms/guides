> **The goal of this guide:** You will learn how to extract information from certain webpages using [developer tools](guides/fixing-errors/readme.md), [node.js](http://blog.modulus.io/absolute-beginners-guide-to-nodejs) and [X-Ray](https://www.npmjs.com/package/x-ray).

# Web scraping with [node.js](http://blog.modulus.io/absolute-beginners-guide-to-nodejs) an [X-Ray](https://www.npmjs.com/package/x-ray)

You can of course start here at [hackertyper](http://hackertyper.com/) and do your swordfish magic! ðŸ¤“

Web scraping enables you to extract information from the web and put it in a more workable format (*.csv*, *excel*, *google spreadsheets*).     

## First things first

1. Create a file ```'filename'.js``` in your designated folder. In this file your code will emerge. Then, create a folder where your information will be displayed ```results.json```.

* Open the [Terminal](http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/get-more-out-of-os-x-terminal-3608274/) application on your mac, go to the folder where you created your files by typing ```cd 'path to you folder'``` enter.

* Install node.js: ```npm install node``` and enter. Then you need X-Ray: ```npm install x-ray```.
